In the code, the RoBERTa model learns the difference between descriptions which specify the usage of machine learning or AI techniques and those which do not. The model can then classify the apps using machine learning techniques by analyzing its description. There are some cases where the model predicts it wrongly, 
Example:

1. Educational apps which provides lessons on AI and machine learning
2. Single player games using AI and multiplayer games
