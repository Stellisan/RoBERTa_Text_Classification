Ever wanted to shrink a friend and pop him in your bloodstream to fight infection when you feel poorly?  No?  Well, you will when you’ve played Anti-virus Adventure!

FREE to download on your iPhone, iPad or iPod.

*****

Here at Muso Labs, some of our boffins have been infected with the Norovirus and are feeling very grotty.  So in an experiment we sent Andy, one of our healthy boffins, on a virus-fighting mission.  Safely inside the ‘Plasma Pod 1000’, Andy was shrunk down smaller than a blood cell and injected into his poorly friend Bernard’s arteries.  

Swimming around in Bernard’s blood stream, Andy is now literally fighting infection from the Norovirus; the influenza virus; bacteria and parasites by shooting at them with penicillin and antibiotics.  But … he must not get hit by any of the viruses, bacteria or parasites, as they will kill him!

To help boost Bernard’s health, Andy must catch the Y-shaped antibodies (proteins that detect and destroy bacteria and viruses) and white blood cells (as they help to fight infection).  

Help Arthur to survive and save poor Bernard from complete misery –

• Using the left side of the screen, move the ‘Plasma Pod 1000’ around to avoid viruses, bacteria and parasites.

• Tap the right side of the screen to shoot the viruses, bacteria and parasites with penicillin and antibiotics.

• Score points by catching as many y-shaped antibodies and white blood cells as possible.

• If you can catch 50 antibodies and white blood cells, you can speed up by unlocking the faster ‘Plasma Pod 2000’.

• If you manage to collect 250 antibodies and white blood cells, you can try the super fast ‘Plasma Pod 3000’.

• See how much healthier you can make Bernard by collecting the most antibodies and white blood cells.

• If you want to avoid any adverts, simply hit the upgrade button.

The latest transmission we received from Arthur was … 
“It’s nasty, tell everyone to avoid infected people where possible, wash laundry and dishes at 80º and above all … WASH YOUR HANDS!”

1414,924848268,"Teachers and parents all over the world use Speed Reading with Edi the giraffe as a funny and effective method to improve the reading skills of their kids.

It's really easy:
Edi the giraffe displays words for a fraction of a second. The aim is to recognize them correctly without sounding them out letter by letter. The level, speed and part of speech can comfortably be adjusted to the level of the child. 

The app is based on the 500 most common english words. It is developed for parents and their children as well as for schools.
Optionally, one can also test German words.

*** Why Sight Words? ***

At the beginning of their reading process, children usually read words letter by letter. Then they combine these letters to a meaningful expression - a word. At some point they become faster and faster such that they are able to read the whole word without sounding out letter by letter.

The transition to this second phase causes problems for many children. This is where this app comes in.

Since here the words flash for only a fraction of a second, the pupil has no chance reading each word letter by letter. This is why this so-called whole-word method is often used as a training in schools to improve the reading speed of the kids. It is especially helpful for children with dyslexia.


*** Game modes ***

Teacher mode: here you can accompany the child. You sit beside the kid and check the words it tells you by yourself. 

Single player mode: here you let the child work alone. The pupil writes the flashed word into a textbox and the app automatically checks the given answer. Here the child also practices the spelling of the 500 most common words.

The more successful the child is, the more rewards and animals it finds.


*** Settings ***

- words per round: 10-40
- speed: 2s - 0.02 seconds
- part of speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives, particles or all together
- language: English, German",1

• Feel your own cosmic bond more strongly
• Live your pure self, free from fear and discord
• Allow goals that arise within to manifest themselves without

You know that everything in our universe is one, and that you are linked to the great vastness. And you also know that you create your reality with your thoughts. Just as you know that your body reflects your own inner state. But how can you use this cosmic energy in an even better manner for yourself, trust yourself more, and find out why you are alive?
The hypnosis program “Get Awareness!” can help you expand your consciousness independently from time and space. You will learn to delve deep within yourself and concentrate on your loving self, which will always point out the right path for you. You will experience your feelings more distinctly as a decisive driving force for reality. And you will learn how to determine more attentively which experiences you decide to undergo in your life.

HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS

“Get Awareness!” is a form of relaxation training that works effectively with the techniques of classical hypnosis and mental coaching. The 32-minute program is aimed at adults and young adults who are open to spirituality, and in particular the laws of the universe. If you would like to learn to use it more effectively, Kim Fleckenstein will open the gate to your subconscious with this audio program. Positive affirmations will then be anchored in your subconscious, strengthening your deep bond with the universe, the divine powers, and all that is — or however you choose to call this great phenomenon.

PLEASE NOTE

Do not listen to this program while operating a motor vehicle or during any other activity that requires your full attention.  This program does not replace a doctor or any other medical aids.  The best effect can be achieved by listening to this program once a day over a period of 4 weeks.",1

1470,1296568587,"Connect 4 Emoji (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Fourplay, Four in a Row, Four in a Line and Gravitrips (in Soviet Union)) is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

Connect 4 Emoji is a 4 in a row emoji game.

""Connect 4 Emoji of your checkers in a row while preventing your opponent from doing the same.""

Playing the game Connect four
Before the game begins, each player chooses a set of checkers (brightly colored disks) and sets them aside. The game pieces come in two forms: regular checkers with holes in the center of them and ""blockers"" which are two discs joined in the center by a small bar. The gameboard is seven spaces wide, six spaces high, and two spaces deep and sits upright so that pieces can be dropped through openings in the top.
As each player takes a turn, he or she chooses which type of checker to use and places it in the opening at the top. The game piece will then slide straight down until it reaches the first unoccupied space within that column.

Connect four emoji game Strategy
During each move, a player decides at what location to place a checker. Each choice should be based on trying to line up one's own checkers while at the same time trying to prevent opponents from lining up their checkers first. Along with regular checkers that take up a single slot on either side of the double grid, each player has two blockers which take up both sides at once. Because the blocker is connected by a rigid bar, it will stop at the higher open slot between the two sides. This can potentially take multiple slots of a single column on one side of the board out of play for all players even though they remain unoccupied by game pieces.

Winning the game Connect 4 emoji
The game is won by the first player who lines up four of his or her checkers in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Checkers can weave back and forth between the two grids as well which increases the number of ways to place four in a row",1

MosaLingua's method, designed by a team of polyglots from over 5 continents with the help of our specialized Russian teacher, is based on proven scientific research.

Check out a video demo on http://mosalingua.com

You'll learn and review the essential 20% of the language that will apply 80% of the time and allow you to travel and communicate with native speakers!

THE PERFECT APP FOR BEGINNERS AND ""FALSE BEGINNERS""
MosaLingua Russian targets two groups of people: 
You want to learn Russian from scratch: you will get the basics needed for traveling or meeting Russian friends, and start speaking basic sentences in no time

You already know some Russian (e.g. you can read Cyrillic and hold a basic conversation): you will develop a stronger vocabulary and learn useful expressions for improving conversation skills.

UNIQUE APPROACH 100% FOCUSED ON SPEAKING, AND SHORTCUTS FOR RAPID LEARNING
Lessons developed by our team of teachers will help you...
► Learn to read Cyrillic in under 3 hours
► Concentrate on the easy aspects of the Russian language

► calculates a personalized review schedule for each Russian flashcard according to difficulty, to encourage efficient and sustainable (long-term) memorization
► spend time learning what you find useful, not what you already know
► MosaLingua constantly adapts to your needs and pace
► use both auditory and visual memory
► starting with your very first lesson, learn the most useful and common Russian words

► you decide how long each Russian learning session will last (whether you have 2 minutes, or 30 minutes to spend learning)
► pause a lesson and pick up where you left off when you have time
► no need for an internet connection; all Russian lessons and content are available offline

FUN AND ADDICTIVE
► unlock bonuses as you progress (dialogues, jokes, fun facts, sayings, tips)

1510,919605660,"Cargomatic is an on-demand technology that connects shippers with nearby carriers who have extra space on their trucks.  

NOTE: Before downloading the Cargomatic Driver App, please complete your profile at cargomatic.com.

The Cargomatic Driver app allows carriers to manage freight directly from their phone, including:

- view available shipments in real time
- accept a job
- receive driving directions
- take a picture of the bill of lading
- email a POD

Cargomatic allows trucking companies to market excess capacity and accept extra shipments that are on their delivery routes.
We offer LTL, FTL and drayage shipping solutions. Our carrier network includes bobtails, tractor trailers, and cargo vans.

**How Cargomatic Works**

Shippers log in to the Cargomatic Shipper App or at http://app.cargomatic.com and enter their shipment information (origin, destination, size, weight, etc.). Two hours before the shipment is scheduled to be picked up, the shipment is displayed on the Driver App and a nearby carrier can accept the job using their smartphone.

By tendering shipments in real time, carriers only see shipments that are on or near their existing routes and ready for immediate pickup. This allows them to maximize the space on their trucks and reduce the number of vehicles a shipper needs to have on hand to accommodate peak business cycles.

Everyday, tens of thousands of trucks with extra capacity are driving by manufacturers and logistics providers who have freight that needs to move in the same direction. Simply by connecting these parties through software, we can reduce truck emissions by improving the ratio of freight moved per vehicle-miles traveled.

What is Spaced Repetition?
Spaced repetition is a learning method that requires increasing intervals of time between periodic reviews of previously learned material in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. Spaced repetition is commonly applied in contexts where a learner must acquire a large amount of knowledge and retain it indefinitely in memory such as when studying for a board exam or learning a second language. 

We have heavily researched many learning studies done by famous authors such as Hermann Ebbinghaus, Sebastian Leitner(Leitner System), Paul Pimsleur, A.W. Melton, Thomas Landauer, Robert A. Bjork, C. A. Mace & H. F. Spitzer from which we extracted the best concepts to ultimately create this technology focused App. Our brilliant team of developers built this proprietary piece of technology which keeps track of when a particular flashcard was reviewed, prompts users to review it again 1 day later, a week later(7 days) & a month later(28 days so 4 weeks). Spacing reviews in this manner insures each flashcard will be learned at least 4 times which almost guarantees the material will be retained in the memory forever. 

Why learn in this manner? 
Well, the famous study on human memory done by German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus describes that within the first 24 hours of learning we forget 50% - 80% of what was learned and without further review, by 30 days we remember merely 2% of the information. Based on these results, Ebbinghaus created his well-known Learning curve & Forgetting curve. According to Ebbinghaus, spaced repetition is the most important factor in order to retain what was learned. Periodic reviews (every 24 hour, week and month later) provide the needed spikes in memory to retain large amount of information as long term memory. 

Awesome Features: 
● Timestamp based flashcard tracking – Know exactly when you reviewed a particular flashcard. 
● Spaced Review Score – Instant updating score system based on spaced review target achieved or missed. 
● Fast Navigation through Flashcards – Bookmark, Favorite & Scroll through 100s of flashcards with ease. 
● Search by Flashcard Deck Category – Instant search results as you type in the search bar with ability to search by categories. 
● Push Notifications  – Once a day push notification at your usual study time to remind you to review your previously learned flashcards. 
● Iconographic Review Reminders – Time based icon updates on every flashcard to remind users when to review a particular card. 
     ...    = Awaiting = Card will open in the future for review. 
     O    = Open = Flashcard needs to be reviewed NOW. 
     X     = Missed = Missed the 24hr window to review the card.
 Check = Done = Successfully reviewed the card.

P.S. We are dedicated to making our technology and learning system as effective as possible, connect with us if you think we can do something to make it even better. We will constantly improve our content and technology to be the Best Educational Service.

For example, HabitMinder will remind you to do breathing exercises or a quick meditation session. It can also track your hydration, encourage you to exercise or go to the gym, and much more.

The app has more than 50 pre-defined positive and healthy habits to get you started. Reminders will promptly notify you it is time to complete your habit. 

Why do you need HabitMinder? Here are some sample healthy habits the app will help you form and keep:

• Walking – the most natural movement and fantastic exercise. Try to hit 10,000 steps a day with the help of HabitMinder – you’ll notice a change.

• Hydration – staying hydrated is one of the best habits for your overall health. After all, water makes up 75% of your muscles, 83% of your blood, and 90% of your brain, so you can’t go wrong. Good hydration promotes healthy skin, it makes your brain stronger, and it can help you lose weight.

• Breathing/Mindfulness – relieve feelings of stress and tension through breathing and mindfulness exercises. This will improve your focus and your mood as well as having a positive impact on your physical health.

• Exercise – you need to exercise to stay fit, lose weight, and stay physically and mentally healthy. HabitMinder can't do the exercise for you but it will help you stay on schedule.

• Stretching – stretching is an essential part of being fit and healthy. It can also help you relax so should be part of your daily routine.

• Stand – it will surprise you when you learn just how much of your day you spend sitting down. Your attention will improve, you will feel more energised, and you will improve your physical health by getting into one simple habit – standing up frequently and regularly.

• Squats – your partner will love this habit and so will you. Your muscles will become firmer and more toned, and you will feel stronger. Squats can even help you lose weight.

• Eat healthily – everyone knows the benefits of eating healthily. Getting into a regular and committed healthy eating habit is easier said than done, however. HabitMinder is the solution – it will help keep your healthy eating plans on track.

• Sleep more – sleep is crucial for your physical and mental health and wellbeing. Even 30 minutes more per night will have a positive impact.

 database by the algorithm.

1532,554177032,"The game of Logic is a great educational and teaching tool for your child. It helps to learn the basic of colors and shapes easily and it helps kids to find similar shapes (figures) and colors in a challenging and fun format. Logic is a 5-in-1 game of inter-related activities allowing you to help your child expand their comprehension, judgment and decision-making. 

A very unique feature of Logic allows you to choose the language which the game uses by selecting the narration language. When you make a match within any game, Logic will pronounce the color, the shape (or both) or the number in the language you choose. Your child can learn spelling and words in different languages – English, Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Swedish, Arabic, Russian and Ukrainian. Dubbing is made by a native speaker of that language (not computer-generated) all words are pronounced very clearly and are very understandable. Initially the game will load in the default iPad language and after that you can change the language settings in the game so that your child can learn colors, shapes, pictures or numbers in another language.

Logic’s features:
* 5 main games: Colors, Numbers, Letters, Pictures and Figures. 
* Logic has 10 geometric forms which help your child to learn shapes.
* All of Logic’s games have a high level of re-playability.  Every time you open a game the position of the tiles is different, and it will be different from the last time it was played. This will make your child think while playing the game.
* The game Pictures will test and expand your child's deductive capabilities. This game is based on colors and shapes, but the colors and shapes are not readily matched.  Instead, the child will look at a tile with a picture on it, and figure out the shape it contains or the color it has in it, and then they will find the matching tile. Your child will find this challenging, but not difficult as it expands their analytic abilities.
* You can regulate the volume of the music or sound in the game, or turn it off.
* Logic is socially aware: you can share the results of the game on Facebook or via email.

1555,916460128,"The Sandtray is a tried and true process used by many Play Therapists with clients of any age.  The Sandtray process is ‘elementally therapeutic by promoting play and relationship’ (Homeyer and Sweeney, 2011).  However, difficulties of the traditional office Sandtray set up can include cost, portability, storage and display of the tray, sand and miniatures.

The Virtual Sandtray App is a revolutionary tool for therapists to utilize in multiple settings where these concerns prohibit traditional Sandtray use.  With the Virtual Sandtray App, a qualified therapist can work with clients in settings such as hospitals, crisis intervention sites, practicum and internship sites.  Basically, any settings where traveling with traditional Sandtray setup is cumbersome or impossible.  

In addition, the virtual elements allow for the expansion and use of items and concepts which are impractical in traditional Sandtray.  These elements include saving of environments for later use, screenshots of environments, backgrounds, rotation of the tray, weather elements, fire, limited animation and resizing items.  Expansion packs can be purchased in addition to the basic sandtray pack and a fabulous collection can travel with the therapist anywhere.",1

With ""Too Loud Kids Noise Meter & Timer"" keeping the kids quiet will become fun and competitive. You set the timer duration, meter sensitivity and start the timer. While the time passes the voice meter measures and graphically shows the noise level. Behind the voice meter there is an animal which reacts to the voice level.

Features: 
• Voice meter with indicator showing if the noise level is low or high 
• Possibility to adjust the sensitivity and dampening of the voice meter – this app can be used not only when you want the kids to be absolutely quiet, but also when you accept a certain level of noise

1572,1400902295,"This is a classical sliding puzzle game for all puzzle game lovers. It consists of a puzzle that has been divided in N x N tiles that have been shuffled. One tile is taken out and the tiles are shuffled. The objective is to move the tiles using the empty tile space in a specific sequence to rearrange the puzzle into its correct original order. This application allows the user to pick among several puzzle images, the number of tiles(3x3, 4x4 or 5x5) and four difficulty levels(easy, medium,hard and no time limit). 

The handling of the Sliding Puzzle is simple. Choose a picture from the sample pictures provided with this app or even can choose an image from your PHOTO LIBRARY or CAMERA and start the mixing of the puzzle pieces with the ""Start"" button. If the puzzle module has finished the shuffling of the pieces, you can start with the solving of the puzzle. 

To rearrange the pieces, just click on a tile or simply swipe to slide it to the empty place. You can restart the slide puzzle at any time. You can set the difficulty level by going to the menu screen and selecting the ""Game modes"" option. At anytime you can restart the puzzle using the same puzzle settings by clicking the Reset button just underneath the main puzzle. 
You can also enable or disable application audio anytime from the main menu. 

The application keeps track of the total number of moves made and the total amount of time taken to complete the puzzle. 

You can compare the puzzle with the reference small image at the bottom left(just underneath the main puzzle)of the screen. The faster and the fewer moves you make, the higher your score. Anytime the puzzle game is paused (back button or home button pressed or another application interrupts the current puzzle), the order of the puzzle as well as the progress so far is retained. Whenever you launch the puzzle application again, you will resume exactly where you stopped with the same order and number of moves. Every time you complete the puzzle and you achieve a high score, you are eligible to add it to the top scores also accessible via the ""High Score"" option. 


Features include: 

1) Number of movements are recorded and the timer is on-so, you will have an idea about the number of steps and the time taken by you to complete the puzzle. 

2) Four difficulty levels : easy, medium, hard and no time limit. 

3) Number of tiles : 3x3, 4x4 or 5x5. 

4) You can view your top score anytime. 

5) Clean animations.

6) You can also enable or disable application audio or tiles number anytime from the main menu. 

7) Solver to solve every puzzle for you!

8) Last but not the least, you can choose the images from these three sources and make that image as your puzzle image : -

•Purchase all 500 high-yield neurology pimping questions for $7.99 on the below-listed topics (based on interviews & feedback from hundreds of medical students, interns, residents, and attending physicians). 

Scrub Wars utilizes the findings of recent groundbreaking research (on enhancing learning in medical education including a landmark article in the Yale Journal of Biology & Medicine) that strongly suggests using gamification to teach complex medical subjects as well as utilizing frequent retesting & spaced repetition to enhance memory retention (see below references).
	
During the development phase, the Scrub Wars franchise was very popular at the 2014 and 2015 AMSA Annual meetings, the 2014 UC Davis Pre-Health Expo, and the 2013 DevLearn/Adobe Learning Summit (among students, professors, physicians, teaching administrators, parents, & gaming experts).

•These are the high-yield neurological topics covered in this game: 

1. Neurology Mixed Preview 
2. Neuroanatomy 
3. Neuropathology 

4. Spinal Cord Lesions 
5. Sensory Systems 
6. Neuropharmacology 1 
7. Neuropharmacology 2

Benefits of this app to medical students, interns, and residents:

Quick Feedback- Green is right, Red is right, and move on!  No long vignettes or explanations to slow you down (do vignettes or seek explanations on your own time).

“Creates” study time- Play Scrub Wars anywhere especially where you normally would not study like waiting in line, between classes, while waiting for rounds to start, or even on the toilet!

Spaced learning- High-yield board facts are reinforced by your Teaching Attending after completing each level (need 70% correct to pass a level). 

Content created by trusted sources- Questions written/edited/tested by physicians, professors, and medical students

Diverse application- In addition to medical students & residents, other professional graduate students can benefit from the content review including physician assistants, podiatrists, physical therapists, anesthesiology residents, and nurses (LVN and RN).

Under the guidance of your professional mentor, the Benevolent Attending, you must now withstand the onslaught of an aggressive campaign led by your megalomaniac chief rival. The time to establish dominance on the wards has begun.  Scrub Wars must now take place!",1

How much does my horse weigh? When is her next farrier appointment? When was her last Coggins test? Horse Keeper is designed to make your horse keeping chores manageable and fun. If you own horses, you know how challenging it can be to keep track of all of your horses' needs.

Keeping track of the many care details for each of your horses is what Horse Keeper is all about. Here is just a sampling of the tracking utility Horse Keeper provides:

Horses:
Create a fully descriptive entry for each of your horses, including picture, health history, parentage, breed, height, weight, and many other details. The health history page lets you enter professional services such as Vaccination, Farrier, Vital Statistics and Dentist appointments, and will even remind you when the next service is due.

Contacts:
Keep track of Veterinarians, Farriers, Dentists, Trainers, etc. The Contacts tab is fully integrated with the built-in Contacts and Mail applications. Pull up your Farrier entry for example, and a phone call or email is just a couple of touches away.

Reminders:
Whenever a service is due, Horse Keeper will ""whinny"" at you, even if it is not open, and will present a message as to what service needs to be performed. In addition, you can enter reminders of your own taking full advantage of Apple's push notification services. Don't forget to fix that fence!

Notes:
When you weigh your horse (weight calculator included!) you can enter dietary notes for each weight entry. The weight entries are then sorted in chronological order so you can track weight changes over time. In addition to dietary notes, There is a Notes tab where you can enter your barn notes. I really need to fix that tractor one of these days. And of course, there is a place to enter notes about each individual horse.

Backup:
You can backup your Horse Keeper data or share it with other Horse Keeper users. To export, simply hit the Backup button on the Horses tab, and select the recipient's email address. To Import, press and hold the attachment on the received email, and select the ""Open in Horse Keeper"" button that appears. Then select those items you wish to add or replace.

Sync:
Synchronize your Horse Keeper data with other users over WiFi. This helps to make Horse Keeping a family endeavor. Just select Synchronize from the More Tab, and select another device which is currently running Horse Keeper. Once the other user grants permission, Horse Keeper will download their data and allow you merge it with your own entries. It's just that simple.

There's too much more to list. All of your info is presented in a logical, tabbed interface. Take a look at the screenshots or visit www.dancethetide.com for more info.

1626,903353128,"Dyslexia Test & Tips is the first app in the world that helps you quickly identify dyslexia and create a profile of the person being tested.

FOR WHO?
This app is meant for children, students and adults either with dyslexia or where there is a chance of dyslexia. You can take the test yourself or as a teacher, parent, family member or colleague, help someone you think could possibly be dyslexic to take the test.
Even if you do not come into direct contact with someone with dyslexia, it can be interesting to take a look at this app in order to gain insight into the behaviour of people with dyslexia and understanding of its impact on their lives. 

DYSLEXIA TEST
This app has been developed out of a deep love and commitment to the profession and with the intention of sharing information so that all can benefit. By doing the dyslexia test yourself, or letting family and friends, colleagues and neighbours take the test, it will soon become clear if there is a possibility of dyslexia. And the sooner professional help can be sought.

IDENTIFICATION
You have the option of first taking the short test found under “Identification’ before taking the more comprehensive test with 35 questions.
The purpose of the app is to quickly get an idea if someone is showing any signs of dyslexia. The earlier dyslexia is recognised, the sooner a treatment plan can be implemented. But be aware, this is an indication and not a diagnosis. 
There is a chance that you will encounter behavioural characteristics in this app which you did not realise were associated with dyslexia.

TIPS
The wide range of tips in this app can contribute to a better future for those with dyslexia. In fact we can all benefit whether dyslexic or not, by improving the way we communicate. 

The app has been extensively tested by psychologists and dyslexia specialists. Children and (young) adults who are not good readers are advised to use the app with someone to help them.",1

The app is developed by midwives with vast experience with waterbirths, both in clinical practice and in education of midwifery students. The app provides you with inspiration and clinical tips for your daily practice as a midwife.

Warm water is relaxing and reduces labour pains. It is affordable, non-invasive and has no side effects. Women, who give birth in water, often express great satisfaction with both pain relief and birth experience.
Most women associate a warm bath with relaxation and self-care, and the feeling of being surrounded by warm water is safe and familiar. In birth, where the woman can feel insecure, safe and familiar is welcome.
The weightlessness in the water makes it easy for the woman to change positions, and changing positions can reduce labour pains and promote birth.

•	’My downloads’: Your downloaded videos and sound files, which you can also use offline.
•	Clinical tips

1733,1225266296,"An Official US Navy mobile application, produced by the Navy PMW 240 Program.

What is the VCNO Standards of Conduct Application?
 
The Vice Chief of Naval Operations (VCNO) Standards of Conduct application is a mobile version of the VCNO’s Standards of Conduct Guidance Memorandum for All Flag Officers, a resource provided to ensure that US Navy Flag Officers and their staffs administer and maintain a comprehensive ethics program. The app provides overarching guidance on Navy Standards of Conduct, as well as targeted 
summaries, tools, and references for the most frequently encountered topics.  

While VCNO’s Standards of Conduct Guidance Memorandum is addressed to Flag Officers, the app is useful for all Navy personnel, in particular Flag staffs, Commanding Officers, Judge Advocates/General Counsel, Ethics Counselors, and others. The VCNO’s Memorandum for All Flag Officers and various Point Papers compose the bulk of the app’s guidance. However, the app also offers Best Practice forms and checklists, as well as dynamic and interactive approaches to help users understand the practical applications of Standards of Conduct guidance. The application is divided into the following sections for ease of use:
  
• Memorandum for All Flag Officers provides the most recent VCNO Standards of Conduct Guidance Memorandum.   
• The Point Papers section includes targeted summaries on a wide range of topics, including travel, gifts, political activities, communications with industry, government vehicles, post-government employment, and other topics, with applicable references to rules, regulations and ethical principles in each area. 
• Best Practice Forms provides worksheets and forms to ensure a well-documented, coordinated staff review of common Standards of Conduct issues.  
• The Annual Ethics Audit Checklists section offers an interactive topical list to be reviewed each year and discussed with an Ethics Counselor. 
• Navigation Channels provides users the ability to explore potential courses of action based on chosen variables.
• The app also includes sections offering References and Useful Links, as well as Emergency resources and a Favorites section for bookmarking parts of the app that a user finds personally important.  

This app requires no authentication or authorization. Please note that the information in this app is not a substitute for legal advice and may not reflect the most current legal and/or policy developments. Users are advised to consult their Ethics Counselor regarding specific legal questions.",1

1764,603985129,"Is your roof suitable for the installation of solar panels? What is the optimal setup and which type of solar panel suits best at your roof? The App Solar Consult can give you the answers directly.

The PRO version is specifically designed for energy consultants and suppliers of solar panels. A PDF file with your own logo can be used by installers as work order or be attached to estimates.

You can display your company name under the orientation meter, you can display your logo, company name and website on [Info], add your own list of solar panels and with step 5, the mail with a request for an tender will be send directly to your own mail address.

With the PRO version you can save a research of a house as a project or reference on your device or in the Cloud. You can save the project in your own or in someone else's Cloud. So you can share your projects between different devices (and colleagues).

The Standard and PRO version allows you to change the characteristics of a solar panel and change the value of the sun angle in the winter. The settings affect the calculations of the required surface of solar panels on pitched and flat roofs and influence the length of the shadow behind a row of solar panels on a flat roof.

The orientation meter works like a compass that will display the deviation from the South (or North). You can put the phone on the roof or hold it against the ceiling. In addition, the inclination of the roof will be measured.

If you are considering installing solar panels, the App can help you in your research whether your roof is suitable for solar panels. The App shows whether there falls enough sunlight on your roof and whether it is worth to install solar panels. You can enter an address or display your current location.

You can enter the details of your roof and the App will calculate for your roof with multiple types of solar panels the maximum output in the tab ‘Characteristics roof’. 

Also, the required surface of solar panels on pitched and flat roofs are displayed. The App displays the length of the shadow behind a row of solar panels.

Roadmap to get an advice from the App Solar Consult:

Step 1 : Hold the iPhone/iPad against the roof to determine the efficiency of solar panels depending of the angle and orientation.

Step 2 : Check the map with the top view of the location and determine the solar irradiation in your region. On a country map, you can see the solar irradiation of your country. You can also enter a different address or country.

Step 3 : Enter the size of the roof and the App can give you an advice with the maximum number of solar panels that can be installed. You can select a different type of solar panel (this is step 4 on the iPhone).

Step 4 (only iPad) : In addition to the advice of the app, the user can customize the system (4th tab). In case of a skylight or chimney, the user can differ from the advice. This screen is also available in the sidemenu on the iPhone. 

Step 5 : Choose tab 5 and enter your details. You can mail the project to your own address or to a supplier for a request.",1

The results of each training exercise are charted for your review. More stars mean that you are getting closer to your objective: more effective reading skills and with it extremely high reading speeds. 

You can check your reading speed at any time using different reading tests from a variety of topics. 
Questions about the text are used as a secondary test to assess your retention ability. This is the ideal combination for mastering effective reading skills and high retention rates. 

But beware: you might get hooked since early progress will motivate you to work on your skills regularly. 
It is fun and you are doing something to stay mentally fit at the same time. 

We recommend that you train regularly but not excessively to ensure best results.

1814,1160254835,"Pinellas County Emergency Management’s Ready Pinellas application is a mobile disaster preparedness and decision support application designed to assist Pinellas County citizens in planning ahead, or when tropical storms approach our area, providing an outline of steps and recommendations and current information.

Ready Pinellas App Features:

Know Your Zone: When a tropical storm approaches it’s critical for residents to know their Evacuation Zone. It’s best to find out your zone before hurricane season so you can access your risk and make plans. As a user, you can enter your address and determine your evacuation level, the closest hotel accommodations, the closest general or special needs shelter. Note: not all shelter and hotel accommodations will be available in all storm levels. Check back with this feature when a storm is approaching.

Readiness Checklist: The Readiness Checklist is a tool to provide users an easy guide for preparedness ahead of hurricane season. There is a Blue Sky Readiness Checklist for pre-storm preparations, and as a tropical storm approaches and Pinellas County is placed in the 5-day or 3-day cone as indicated by the National Hurricane Center, the app will present the 5-day Readiness Checklist and then the 3-day Readiness Checklist. 

Get a Plan: This feature helps citizens, businesses and special needs citizens create an emergency preparedness plan. Users can enter information about the location of their homes and businesses, family members, pets and family contact information and an individualized emergency plan will be developed that users are able to print or maintain online.

Alert Pinellas: The most important step you can take to be prepared is to know when a hazard is coming. The Alert Pinellas emergency notification service allows Pinellas County to send urgent messages by voice to landlines and mobile devices, text, TDD and via email. Registration is free, and users can register each address where they live and work to get alerts for multiple locations.

Storm Surge Protector: This interactive tool depicts the impact that different levels of storm surge flooding would have on a neighborhood, home or business. Users can type in their address and see a representative graphic illustration of their structure type with a depiction of the projected height of storm surge for the different evacuation levels. It also displays the specific evacuation level for the address and the amount of storm surge predicted for that evacuation level in a neighborhood view.

Special Needs: Pinellas County’s special needs program is intended for those who need transportation or require minimal medical assistance while seeking public shelter. Registration for a special needs shelter is required and this feature allows users to register. 

Pet Preparedness: Get information on sheltering your pet, and a list of supplies needed to weather the storm. Find out information on pet collection or information about locating stray animals following a hazard event. There are also pet friendly shelters and pet coordination for special needs citizens. A link brings you to registration forms.
 
Social Media: Follow Pinellas County on social media for general county information, breaking news, preparedness tips and real-time updates.

Pinellas County All Hazards Preparedness Guide: Download a PDF version of Pinellas County’s All Hazards Guide, with information on how to prepare for and respond to hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, lightning and manmade disasters.

National Hurricane Center: Connect to the official source for worldwide tropical predictions, weather, water and climate data, and analyses of hazardous tropical weather. Find translations and podcasts.

By  sharing  your  driving  data,  you’re  helping  us  improve  our  accident  detection  technology  and  make  driving  safer  for  everyone  on  the  road. 

How it works: 
Download the app and give MileUp permission to access your location and motion sensors. These are used to track your driving activity and give you useful stats on your driving behavior. Through your driver dashboard, you’ll learn how many trips you’ve taken and for how long.  It also rates your performance in the following areas:

•	Handling — Tracks how much braking, accelerating, and cornering you do throughout your trip.
•	Speed — Determines how fast you’re driving relative to the posted speed.  
•	Phone Usage — Measures how distracted you are by your phone, influencing your ability to spot hazards.

Then, your driver dashboard does scientific number-crunching to see how you stack up against other MileUp drivers, plus gives you an overall driving style rating.  Based on your stats, you can see where you rule behind the wheel and where you…ah, don’t. 

You can use this info to become a safer driver and help us make driving safer for everyone on the road.",1

1856,602412524,"1+1 Dice helps to teach children the addition of two numbers with the help of two dices . The app doesn't use any words, so the app can be used for children in any language. The app was produced in cooperation with teachers and was tested by teachers. The app is based on the Leitner-System, means questions will be repeated until the child learned the answer. Let your child finish this app, and your child will know simple addition.

REFERENCES:

Ludwig Hanisch, director of elementary school, Germany : The app 1+1 Dice is aimed at making the first acquaintance with quantities and numbers by using dice points and ten-point-series. Dice points prepare recognizing all kinds of quantities, what is the condition for understanding numbers generally.
In the lessons dice points get continuously connected with numbers in a playing way and enable preschool-age children and newcomers in school to do the lessons by their own.
After successfully completing the lesson children are rewarded by sounds and little games and so motivated to continue.
As a headmaster of elementary school with many years of experience I can give my best recommendations to the app 1+1 Dice.

teachingappz.co.uk : Possible Classroom Uses: Use the app as part of your Maths lessons as a whole class teaching tool. Let children reinforce their Maths skills independently or in small groups. Challenge children to work through the difficulty levels to improve their skills.

appabled.com : This app is a great teaching tool for young children. It’s a wonderful introduction to addition skills, as it is simple and easy to use.  No spoken words so can be used by children worldwide. When the child successfully completes the lesson, they are rewarded with musical sounds and delightful animations which encourages the child to continue and reinforce learning skills.  This is an excellent simple addition app for visual learners.  Children are being educated and entertained at the same time.  Math has never been so much fun!

bestappsforkids.org : This is a great Teacher Tool to reinforce classroom lessons! Kids love the enticing graphics! Kids have a strong reaction to auditory praise and happy sounds. The charming sounds, repetition and praise keep the kids learning and coming back for more.

theappyladies.com/11-dice : If you are looking for an app that teaches early addition in small, clear, simple steps, this just might be the app you are looking for.

appymall.com :  A wonderful little app to help your children with their maths.

Deborah Ray from Apps for Parents : My son really likes the app and prefers using it to the more traditional maths apps we have.

Jo Adams : We're really enjoying this app - H takes a few days to come back with things she's learned (she listens, processes then tells me), but just yesterday she was telling me what 4 + 3 = - and that's down to this app! Thank you!

Ted Nash, CEO Liquid5.com : Some really awesome apps from this developer! Highly rated!

Super Mommy To The Rescue : 1+1 Dice app is really cute for kids to learn addition.


HOW IT WORKS:

The app is split in an area for boys and an area for girls. You can enter the girl or boy area from the start page.
Every area is split again in ten levels. In every level there are four equations, which the child has to solve. In last level many questions will be repeated again. The app is based on a modification of the Leitner System: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard That means, the questions in a level are repeated until the child gives the right answer. Thus, the answers will be incorporated into the memory of the child. So it creates a real learning effect. If child did all correct, the level is finished with a motivation page. On that motivation page there are many hidden buttons, if child touch it, the child will get a surprise. In case child got enough scores, next level will be opened. The child has to play one level at least two times to get enough scores.

1868,1351095833,"Mass molarity calculator is a useful tool which allows you to calculate the mass of a compound required to prepare a solution of known volume and concentration

An example of a molarity calculation using the mass molarity calculator
What is the mass of compound required to make a 10 mM stock solution in 10 ml of water given that the molecular weight of the compound is 197.13 g/mol?

How to calculate mass
Mass (m) is the amount of matter present in a substance. The value is constant and, unlike weight, is not affected by gravity.

Mass, molar concentration, volume, and formula weight are related to each other.
The mass molarity calculator is based on the following equation:

Mass (g) = Concentration (mol/L) * Volume (L) * Formula Weight (g/mol)

Formula weight (F.W.) is the sum of the atomic weights of all atoms in a given empirical formula. For example: Sodium chloride (NaCl) has one atom of sodium (Na) and one atom of chlorine (Cl). The atomic weight of sodium is 22.99 g/mol and chlorine is 35.45 g/mol. Therefore, the formula weight of NaCl is 58.44 g/mol (22.99 g/mol + 35.45 g/mol).

Also included chemical elements listed by atomic mass for fast reference. Table list include Atomic number, Atomic Mass, Symbol and Chemical Element name.

Molar concentration is the amount of a solute present in one unit of a solution. Its units are mol/L, mol/dm3, or mol/m3. “Molar concentration” is also known as “molarity” and can be denoted by the unit M, molar. If we want to prepare 1 L of 0.5 M sodium chloride solution, then as per the formula we require 29.22 g of sodium chloride (0.5 mol/L * 1L * 58.44 g/mol = 29.22 g).

The mass molarity calculator tool calculates the mass of compound required to achieve a specific molar concentration and volume.

1881,591926846,"Str is a minimalist strength-training app that makes building strength as easy as possible. Unlike other workout tracking apps, Str sticks to known strength-building protocols that work. Pick a routine, and let Str handle your tracking.

The core routine in Str is based on the Starting Strength protocol by Olympic coach Mark Rippetoe (http://startingstrength.wikia.com), and is built around three sets of five reps for most exercises to maximize strength gains. (If you'd prefer to switch to a different routine, Str also supports related protocols: Practical Programming, Onus Wunsler, Wichita Falls, and Advanced Novice.)

When you launch Str, the number of sets for each exercise are predetermined. Simply tap to mark how many reps you accomplished in each set, and log your workout. Str will automatically identify the exercises for the following session, and will also increase or decrease an exercise's weight based on your progress.

Forget about doing math in your head - Str will calculate your loads as well as your warmups, automatically rounding decimals to ensure your recommended weight can actually be loaded on the barbell. Str calculates your working loads, your warmup loads, and even breaks down how much weight to add to each side of the bar! (Tap on an exercise name on the main screen to show this info.)

At first launch, Str is set up for those new to the Starting Strength program. If you're already on the Starting Strength program, however, you can manually override the recommended loads to jump up to your current working weight. You can even adjust the automatic increments for each exercise if you're starting to stall. (Swipe left/right on the warmup screen to change weight.)

Str lets you switch between pound and kilogram labels depending on your preference. Str will also show stats and graphs of your progress for each exercise on the warmup screen.

A dark theme is also included for those who fight for the Dark Side.

After you complete a workout, a summary is copied to your clipboard, so you can paste the info. into a journaling app, or the social networking app of your choice.

1888,524817999,"Our Mulch Pro Estimator has the ability to calculate the amount of mulch required for your project in cubic yards and / or by bags. 

This app will allow you to calculate an unlimited number of areas.

Our app also allows for extra. This is an important feature. Mulch, is sold by volume and is calculated in a uncompacted loose form. When you use it on your project, you'll most certainly want to pack it down some. The ability to include extra is a useful estimating procedure. Our app explains how to use this feature clearly. 

Include tax and material rates for a complete estimate. Add client info and you can email result to your office for review or directly to client for approval.

Why Did We Develop This App: 

Too many folks, have a difficult time remembering industry standard formulas and conversions when it comes time to calculate materials. 

Mistakes can be made when: 

1. Estimators forget to convert inches to feet when used in formulas. Imagine using 6"" when the formula required you to convert the inch to feet first. You'd be way off on your estimate as the formula used 6"" when in fact it should have been .5' 

2. Estimators forget the constant numbers used to convert cubic feet to cubic yards. Many times it's hard to remember do I use 9 as a constant (when converting area calculations) or 27 (when converting volume calculations). Sometimes it becomes even more confusing, if you don't actually need to perform a conversion but you do. 

3. Estimators forget to include a % of extra material to account for compaction factors or waste material. By not including the extra % required, you'll find yourself short of material on the job. 

Who Is This App For: 

Our Mulch Pro Estimator is a valuable tool for contractors, retailers, students and home owners alike. If you work with landscape materials you'll find that our app will aid you in calculating proper quantity takeoffs. 

You're task is to measure the required areas, our app will do the rest. 

Starting The App: 

When you first open the app, you will be presented with three important calculating options. Depending on the method of calculation you wish to use, our app will determine which calculator type will be called up for use. 

We designed our app to accommodate the different ways folks measure. Some like to measure an area by length & width, while others will have already determined the area and may not remember the actual length & width measurements. 

Methods Used To Determine Answers: 

All industry acceptable methods of determining answers, equations and quantity takeoffs are used in calculating proper answers. 

Our app is unique as we allow you to adjust certain formulas with custom data. Don't worry we only allow this when needed and indicate so, in the calculator interface. 

As an example, when you're trying to find out how much mulch you require, we allow you to select which way your going to purchase it.  i.e. cubic yards or bags.  As well, we allow you to input the depth of mulch, and the size of the bag!

  The app can provide guidance on work/rest ratios and fluid intake due to high temperatures. WeatherFX is an app that can retrieve temperature, barometric pressure and relative humidity based on the iPhone/iPad GPS data. The app will also approximate the wet bulb and wet bulb globe (WBGT) temperatures from the retrieved values. Please note that the WBGT is just an estimate. The estimate does not account for wind or low light conditions. The estimate is based on a moderate amount of sunlight. True WBGT can only be acquired through WBGT instrumentation. 
  Once you accept the prompt to acquire the GPS position, the Latitude and Longitude labels will be populated. Click the “Update” button and the app will populate the temperature, pressure and humidity text fields based the closest weather Station ID to your position. The app will then calculate the wet bulb and WBGT temperatures. You'll also notice that the WeatherFX app will place the location name and time of the reading at the top of the screen. This way you will know if the readings are in your location and timely. 
  Besides acquiring the weather from GPS you may get your own estimates for wet bulb and WBGT temperatures by typing temperature, pressure and humidity into the respective text fields. Click the “Manual” segmented button, enter the white fields followed by clicking the “Update” button.

Barometric pressure may be converted from inches mercury to millibars and vice versa by clicking the desired “in” or “mBar” segmented buttons. 
After an update you will be presented with a flag condition button on the bottom left of the screen. The flag condition is derived from the WBGT estimate. If the flag condition is not “NONE”, you may click on the condition to yield work to rest ratios and water consumption given the current estimated flag condition.

BRISK WALKING BENEFITS YOUR HEALTH

We all know how important it is to be active. The good news is that you don’t have to go to the gym or start expensive fitness programmes, walking counts too!

Just ten minutes of brisk walking every day can get your heart pumping  and can make you feel more energetic, as well as lowering your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Going for a brisk walk is a great way to clear your head.

Active 10s are simple to fit into your day, from taking the dog out to going for a lunchtime walk. 

Note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can impact battery life.

This app relies on your phone’s inbuilt sensors to measure activity so you may experience varying levels of accuracy especially in older devices/operating systems. To improve accuracy, keep your phone in a pocket close to your body rather than in a loose coat pocket or bag.

	Developed by leading parenting expert Dr. Mark L. Brenner MFT, PhD, The Bully Alert Plus™ is a powerful App that sends out a text alert or e-mail in real-time alerting an assigned school official that your child has been bullied, has witnessed bullying, or has experienced any other social issue that bothers them. Most students are too embarrassed to walk in the front office of their school to report a problem.  They do not want to be seen by other students  Now, with one-click, the school finds the student who sent the alert (very discreetly) and takes action immediately on their behalf.

The primary feature of Timecode Tool gives the user the ability to convert between 23.98, DF, NDF and PAL timecodes. PAL video runs at a faster speed than NTSC and consequently causes issues when trying to find the same spot in a feature film between those standards. Perhaps you are performing a QC pass on a PAL version of a feature film and find an issue at 2:14:30:23. How do you find the same spot in the NTSC version? Timecode Tool will easily allow you to enter the PAL timecode of 2:14:30:23 and will return to you the equivalent 23.98, DF, and NDF timecodes. It has a default value of 1 Hour as the starting time of your program material but the other 23 even hours can be selected if necessary. (A future version may allow the user to select a specific ""non-even hour"" timecode if there are enough requests)

The second feature of Timecode Tool helps the user vari-speed audio that is currently running at the wrong speed. The hope is that you are using a software program that allows you to convert your audio by entering a specific sample rate (""Import Audio""). Both the difference in percentage and the correct sample rate necessary to vari-speed (VSO) when importing/exporting are provided. Example: you may have an audio file that is 20 frames shorter than it is supposed to be. After entering that file's current length, target length, and current sample rate, a simple math calculation is performed and the user is provided with the numbers necessary to import that file at a custom rate where it should stay in proper sync. 

The third feature is A-Frame Verification. A-Frames occur on the same frames from second to second within a given minute. If you need to locate an A-Frame to keep the proper cadence when editing, tap the upper timecode to change the starting A-Frame for your program material/feature (if other than 01:00:00:00) and then tap the lower timecode to enter your edit point. Touch the A-Frame button to display the frames on which your A-Frame will occur within that given minute of time.",1

With Kids ABC Letter Trains, your preschool and kindergarten-aged kids will learn each letter's name and sound, trace letter shapes, identify letters in context, and match lower to upper case letters.

The game has 5 activities:

1. Build the Railroad. This activity is a fun way for children to learn the name and the appearance of each letter in the alphabet. Kids will enjoy as each station lights up with the announcement of a letter.

2. Drive the Train. Kids get to practice making their very own letters, both upper and lower cases, by carefully tracing the letter on a railroad track with their choice of train car.

3. Garages with Surprises. Children are now tested to see if they can find the right letter. They need to open the correct garage, as their engine drives inside and pulls out a cargo car with a surprise.

4. Phonics Cargo Train.  This activity teaches children to identify correct letter sounds within the context of words. The child’s task is to load the correct cargo boxes into the train.

5. Engine Search. Children get to think fast as they match upper and lower case letters before the trains have time to move away. Phonics is reinforced by hearing the letter’s sound after they make the correct match.",1

1956,1281365800,"Fastest and easiest to navigate speed dialer
using fun images for up to 81 contacts.
Easy to see and click from arm’s length.

SAVE TIME AND MAKE DIALING FUN
If you are not a fan of voice dialing, chances are that you are still using the Contacts app. This is slow and inefficient since finding your contact takes a lot of time.  Widget shortcuts require a lot of swiping and save little time.  Other fav dialer apps use dialing with photos (requiring you to have a pic of every contact in your phone), create clutter with too many non-essential features, and have busy screen layout so it takes time to scan the screen until you find your contact.  We just couldn’t find the perfect dialer for our personal use.  That’s when we decided to create EasyFunDial!

WHY USE IMAGES RATHER THAN JUST NAMES OR PHOTOS
Yes, it's more fun but it's also faster. Spotting the image of a ring that you associated with your spouse or a baseball with your child or a deck of cards with your poker buddy or a money stack with your shopaholic friend is faster than looking for a photo or just the name.  Getting and uploading a photo of every contact is also a pain.  Plus, would you rather be looking at the photo of your boss or an image of a poop emoticon!? (but don’t get fired! :)

Please choose our App because it’s THE: 

FASTEST
The fastest way to dial is to associate your favorite contacts with images and to view them in a simple 3x3 matrix along with the contact’s name below each image.  This simple feature is what makes our app the world’s fastest image dialer.  

EASIEST TO SEE AND CLICK
When you open EasyFunDial, you can easily see the 9 images on each screen from far away.  So even if you don’t have your glasses or if you need to click from an arm length away (e.g. when the phone is clipped to your car dashboard), you can use our app with ease.  [never use any apps that require touch while driving].

MOST INTUITIVE TO NAVIGATE (UP TO 81 CONTACTS!)
EasyFunDial offers you 9 screens for a maximum of 81 contacts.  You can name each screen (e.g. “Family”, “Best Friends”, “Work”) and apply a custom color.  As you swipe to navigate between the screens, a screen map on the top left shows which screen you are on and arrows at the bottom show in which directions you can swipe.

MOST FUN: CHOOSE FROM 100+ IMAGES 
EasyFunDial is fun to create and use, testing your imagination and creativity.  Choose images for each of your contacts from our library in a variety of categories, including animals, arts, bar & casino, footwear, emoticons, foods, hobbies, love, music, sports, transportation and more.  So let your imagination run wild as you associate a unique image with each of your contacts.  Scroll down to see some examples below.

USING THE APP
1. Open the EFD app (instead of “Contacts” or “Phone” apps as you may be doing now)
2. Click on the image you’ve associated with the contact (their name will also be below)
3. Click “Call” (2nd click avoids butt dialing)

Many users move the EasyFunDial app to their Favorites (the 4 apps you pin to the bottom of your screen) since they access it all the time.

ADDING CONTACTS
1.	Click the + button (bottom left).
2.	Find the contact in your address book and click on the number you want to fast dial.
3.	Select the image you want to link to this contact from our image library.

By clicking the “pencil” (bottom right), you can change the image, delete or change the position of the contacts on the screen via simple drag-and-drop. 

EXAMPLES OF IMAGE ASSOCIATIONS
•	Wife: ring, handcuffs, boxing gloves
•	Husband: beer, cards, drill, golf ball
•	Mom: police car, fire truck, cookies
•	Boss: money, sports car, angry emoticon, golf ball

***** WONDERFULLY EDUCATIONAL NEW READING PROGRAM FOR BEGINNING READERS (AGES 2-7). 
***** Developed in cooperation with educational specialists by an award-winning educational studio, 22learn, the creator of the best-selling Sight Words Learning Games and the reading program Phonics: Fun on Farm, to best prepare your children for success in kindergarten and school curriculum. 


================================ 
* 18 FUN EDUCATIONAL GAMES TO LEARN SIGHT WORDS! *
* Entirety of 220 SIGHT WORDS from the popular Dolch list (with extra 94 NOUNS!)*
* Preschool, Kindergarten, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Grade Categories * 
================================

Sight Words Adventure in Candyland helps children learn and practice reading the most common sight words. Sight words are the most frequent words in children’s literature. Many of these words do not have a simple letter-to-sound correspondence, and thus must be learned “by sight”.

Mastery of these words can rapidly increase the child’s reading fluency because it eliminates the child’s time-consuming attempts at decoding these high-frequency words. Sight Words Adventure in Candyland features the most commonly taught list of sight words, the Dolch Word List. Originally compiled by Dr. Edward W. Dolch, this list is divided into 5 categories and includes an extra category for nouns.

Sight Words offers children an easy-to-use interface and a grand choice of 18 fun educational games through which children can acquire mastery over this subject matter.

================================
In Sight Words Adventure in Candyland, Abby the Monkey goes on an adventure in Candyland. Candyland is a fairy-tale land inhabited by cute little pink unicorns, trees full of delicious candy fruit, and chocolate rivers. The unicorns need the learners’ help to grow magical plants that grow on clouds and sustain this land. The learners play educational games to gain gardening supplies and grow the beautiful magical plants.

Забудьте про букеты, которые будут ""похожими"" на картинку в инстаграме, курьеров в метро, послания, написанные корявым почерком, и многочисленные звонки с уточнениями вам и вашему адресату. 

Доставка цветов должна быть незаметной, как обслуживание в первоклассном отеле. Чтобы организовать идеальную доставку цветов нужно просто нажать пару кнопок в этом приложении для iPhone. Обо всём остальном мы позаботимся так, как будто доставляем этот букет для себя.

БУКЕТЫ
- Мы используем только самые лучшие и качественные цветы, которые в принципе можно найти. Все цветы старше двух дней от поставки автоматически списываются, поэтому время от времени нам приходится убирать букеты из линейки.
- Мы не используем искусственные материалы, такие как флористическая губка, кризал или анкор, потому что если цветы свежие им не нужно ничего, кроме воды.
- Все наши букеты собираются по строго регламентированным формулам, поэтому ваш адресат получает именно тот букет, который вы выбрали на экране своего телефона.

ДОСТАВКА
- Вы никогда не задумывались как и кто доставляет букет получателю в обычном сервисе доставки цветов? В 90% случаев используется самая дешёвая рабочая сила - курьеры. Они ездят на метро и такого пункта, как комфорт  получателя просто нет в их мыслях.
- Мы доставляем цветы только на фирменных автомобилях силами симпатичных молодых агентов, главная задача которых заключается в том, чтобы букет оказался в руках получателя максимально комфортным для неё / него образом.
- В GardenPoetry самые точные интервалы доставки в Москве (полчаса).

ПОСЛАНИЯ
- Мы верим, что послание является не менее важным элементом букета, чем сами цветы. Поэтому все наши послания пишутся пером на дизайнерской бумаге. Отдельное внимание мы уделяем почерку, в котором наши писари не уступят лучшим каллиграфам города. 

Спасибо, что используете GardenPoetry. Мы открыты к любым комментариям и пожеланиям по адресу support@gardenpoetry.com

GardenPoetry is the best way to set up a perfect flower delivery in Moscow.

Forget about tasteless bouquets made with cheap flowers, couriers worming through crowds in Moscow Metro and notes  with awful handwriting. 

Every single detail in flowers delivery means a lot. Because it represents a sender and his/her attitude towards the recipient. This service is all about the details.

BOUQUETS
- We simply use the best flowers that one can get. Mostly from Holland and Italy. Plus one very special production in Russia that grows amazing French fragrant roses.

DELIVERY
- All our bouquets are delivered in branded cars by specially trained agents. These agents are good-looking with nice manners and above all they care about comfort of your recipient.

NOTES
- We believe that a note is as important as a bouquet itself. Calligraphy is an art and we have specially dedicated people who work to make handwriting at GardenPoetry as good as the best in Moscow.

Thanks for using GardenPoetry. We are available at support@gardenpoetry.com for all sorts of comments or suggestions.",1

We have designed this application for Africans living in Africa and received the support of native speakers to record all dialects.

Therefore, this application is more practical for conversation in Africa.  In some cases, in consultation with native speakers, we have omitted short phrases or words in the original dialects and replaced them with English or French, as the original words and phrases are seldom used nowadays.

We had discussions with native speakers about the best way to translate and record the phrases and words in this application.  There are some phrases that do not exist in certain dialects and so it was decided, in consultation with the native speakers, to record similar phrases close in significance.

We do not provide the phonetic spelling or written version of these dialects, since it would be impossible to represent the variety and uniqueness of sounds.
