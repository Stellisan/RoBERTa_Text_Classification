NCLEX (National Council Licensure Examination) is an examination for the licensing of nurses in the United States and Canada. There are two types, the NCLEX-RN and the NCLEX-PN. After graduation from a school of nursing, one takes the NCLEX exam to receive his or her nursing license. A nursing license gives an individual the permission to practice nursing, granted by the state where he or she met the requirements.

NCLEX examinations are developed and owned by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, Inc. (NCSBN). The NCSBN administers these examinations on behalf of its member boards which consist of the boards of nursing in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and the Virgin Islands.

To ensure public protection, each board of nursing requires a candidate for licensure to pass the appropriate NCLEX examination, NCLEX-RN for registered nurses and the NCLEX-PN for vocational or practical nurses. NCLEX examinations are designed to test the knowledge, skills and abilities essential for the safe and effective practice of nursing at the entry-level.

NCLEX examinations are provided in a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) format and are presently administered by Pearson VUE in their network of Pearson Professional Centers (PPC). individual will be scored by their ability to think critically about decisions involving nursing care

39,886571107,"The working (or short-term) memory is a key brain function which allows us to not just remember given information for several seconds, but also to picture it in our minds. In contrast to the long-term memory, which saves information even after you begin focusing on something else, information in the short-term memory completely disappears as soon as you turn your attention to something new. One such example is when you see a phone number from an advertisement - unless you jot it down quickly or repeat it to yourself until you memorize it (therefore storing it in your long-term memory) you will forget it as soon as you tun your attention to something else.

The capacity of a working memory depends on the person, but on average a person's working memory is at its best at about 25 years old. Generally, after the age of 25, a person's short-term memory begins to decrease without practice and training to keep it in good form. 

Flipped Numbers helps to train your memory as it works to both maintain and increase the capacity of a person's working memory while also improving productivity in everyday life.

58,1257767077,"Werken in zon en hitte brengt risico's met zich mee. Niet alleen het risico dat je verbrandt; je kunt ook oververhit raken, uitdrogen of een hitteberoerte krijgen. Sommige mensen lopen door hun gezondheid ook meer risico dan anderen. Waar liggen de grenzen? En waar kun je zelf op letten? De hitte-index app van CNV Vakmensen geeft advies. 

De hitte-index app meet hoe warm het is op de plek waar jij werkt. De app toont zowel de actuele temperatuur als de hitte index, de luchtvochtigheid en de zonkracht. De meting kun je doorsturen, bijvoorbeeld naar een collega. Je ziet in de app ook een overzicht van de temperaturen in het hele land. Push-notificaties waarschuwen je bij hoge temperaturen.

Wanneer is het te warm?

Er zijn geen wettelijke normen over wanneer het te warm is om te werken. Alleen de cao voor dakdekkers heeft hier afspraken over. Dat betekent dat je dus ook zelf moet opletten en zo nodig maatregelen moet nemen. De hitte-index app kan je hierbij helpen.

Hitte-index

De hitte-index app geeft aan welk risico je loopt. Hoe hoger de hitte-index, hoe hoger het risico. Het gaat hierbij niet alleen om de temperatuur, maar ook om de luchtvochtigheid. Bij een hogere luchtvochtigheid voelt een bepaalde temperatuur al snel minder prettig. De hitte-index wordt bepaald met de temperatuur in de schaduw. Als je in de volle zon werkt, kun je er 10 graden bij optellen.

Let ook op de zonkracht 

De hitte-index zegt niets over de zonkracht. Houd er rekening mee dat de zon erg sterk kan zijn, ook op dagen dat het niet zo warm is. Op het midden van de dag is de zon op zijn sterkst. De hoogste temperatuur worden vaak pas in de tweede helft van de middag bereikt.",0

******

We can't calm the storm. But the storm can calm us.

Join us, over 1,000,000 relaxed Ladies and Gentlemen who immerse ourselves in realistic thunderstorms any time we wish to relax, focus, sleep or meditate.

Join the Thunderspace revolution and experience the great benefits Thunderspace will bring to your busy life.

Thunderspace's spectacular 3D audio sound field reproduction technology delivers a realistic, high-quality open space sonic ambience over regular stereo headphones. How so? Think 3D glasses for 3D film. Left eye, right eye. Your brain combines these two images into a 3D image. The same principle works for sound: Left ear, right ear. Thunderspace audio is biomimetic: It reproduces the ambient sound field exactly the way you hear. As if you were there. With interaural time and level differences. The storm rumbles high above you, and the rain falls around you. Once you experience the transportive sonic ambience, you will never again want to go back to simple stereo.

Precisely synchronized lightning flashes, frequent updates with new premium quality thunderstorms, a carefully crafted user interface, and highest quality recordings from Emmy-award winning nature sound recordist Gordon Hempton separate Thunderspace from all other relaxation apps.

Thunderspace teleports your mind to a place far away from stress. Far away from the noise. So you can focus on your work, sleep better and relax.

101,1368391947,"Face Data Recorder allows you to record the expressions of your face. The capture of facial data requires a iPhone X. When you start the application, place the phone right in front of you, looking at the front camera. Press the record button and simulate the expressions. The application generates a .anim file, which you can later import into other programs to animate your characters.
You can use blendshape coefficients to animate a 2D or 3D character in ways that follow the user’s facial expressions. ARKit provides many blend shape coefficients, resulting in a detailed model of a facial expression; however, you can use as many or as few of the coefficients as you desire to create a visual effect. For example, you might animate a simple cartoon character using only the jawOpen, eyeBlinkLeft, and eyeBlinkRight coefficients. A professional 3D artist could create a detailed character model rigged for realistic animation using a larger set, or the entire set, of coefficients.
You can also use blend shape coefficients to record a specific facial expression and reuse it later

102,1213202702,"This call recording app is extremely easy to use. All in/outbound calls can be recorded in a fully automatic manner. A simple setup of call forwarding to a recorder line makes this automatic recording a beautifully seamless experience. Recordings are easy to review because they are organized for quick retrieval. The app will surely help relieve your stress of trying to remember everything in your daily activities.

The app offers a free trial for you to run through the entire process of receiving and making calls with auto recording and short text preview. To activate auto recording for all incoming calls, you only have to tap a forwarding contact in your phone’s Contacts (or activate the feature in the phone’s Settings), and that will forward every incoming call to a recorder line dedicated to you, and the incoming call will ring your phone via the app just like a normal call. Once you finish your call, the call recording with a short text preview will appear automatically in the app. The recordings are organized in multiple ways for your easy access – listed chronologically, grouped by callers and grouped by tags. As a workday example, you can enable the recorder line with a single tap in the morning to initiate auto recording for incoming calls, and disable it with another tap at day-end if you don’t want the evening calls to be recorded. The outbound calls, on the other hand, are recorded automatically whenever you place them through the app. These simple steps give you the flexibility to control the recording of all your calls.

The main features are designed to give your callers the best experience, to make your workday most productive, and to give you the best user experience:

- Automatic call recording in audio files.
- Short text preview.
- Sorting of recordings by contacts or chronological order.
- Tagging of recordings.
- Export of voice files (email, Dropbox, Google Drive and other apps).
- Integration with phone’s address book.
- Show your phone number as Caller ID when making outgoing calls.
- Outbound calls to the contiguous United States, Hawaii, Canada and landlines in Mexico.

A free trial is provided so that you can test if call forwarding is supported by your carrier for routing your incoming calls to the recorder line. Note that call forwarding charges by your carrier (in usage or in fees) may be incurred depending on your cellular plan. Please check your wireless plan carefully.

You can purchase a Pay-As-You-Go (Prepaid) Plan or a Monthly Subscription to activate the full service. Prepaid Plan purchases start as low as $0.99 and you pay according to usage with no expiration for the credits. The Prepaid rates are $0.05/min for talk time and $0.10/day for recorder service. The Monthly Subscription gives you a 25% saving at $5.99 per month and will include 100 minutes of free talk time in each month and no recorder service fees. Payment for the subscription will be charged to iTunes at confirmation of purchase. Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. The renewal will be charged to your account within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period at the same monthly rate. You can manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings after purchase. Any unused credits of other plans will be forfeited when you switch to a new plan. Unused free talk time will also be forfeited at the end of each subscription period. Purchase of additional talk time does not expire but can only be used in an active subscription.

106,651690266,"V1connection, the app. See the Threat Picture, a breakthrough in analyzing radar threats. Works with the Valentine One detector. Screen out false alarms with our game-changing Arrow-in-the-Box concept. Every signal on every band gets its own directional arrow and frequency readout. Flashing arrow points to the Priority Alert. V1connection LE brings Dark Mode, Muting, and new programming options. Lets you relocate V1’s front-panel warning to an eyes-only location. Downloads, and upgrades, are free. Demo Mode lets you see the Threat Picture at no cost. 

YOU’LL SEE THE THREAT PICTURE 
See our exclusive Radar Locator with its illuminated arrows pointing toward each threat as the Bogey Counter tracks multiple threats. But now, with V1connection LE, a wireless Bluetooth® communicator, V1 shows you a revolutionary new way of analyzing radar threats. 

ARROW IN THE BOX 
Radar makers, under penalty of law, must certify to the FCC the frequencies used by the equipment they sell. We constantly monitor those certifications so we know exactly where real radar operates on each band. V1 scans the entire width of all radar bands but to draw your attention to the Active Radar Zones, we outline them with a yellow Box. To be in compliance with federal regulations, all radars (except photo) must operate “in the Box.” When you see an arrow outside the Box, that’s probably a false alarm; when it’s in the Box, take the threat seriously until you’ve positively identified it. 

ADVANCED SITUATION AWARENESS 
The Threat Picture (aka Picture Screen) displays a separate arrow for every threat within range, pointing ahead, beside or behind, according to its direction from your car. The arrows grow larger as the signal strength increases. Your visual scan of the Threat Picture lets you see which arrows are in the Box, and spot critical trends—which alerts are maturing into threats and which are fading in concern. 

SITUATION AWARENESS FOUR WAYS 
Choose among four information screens at any time. New: the Quad Screen emphasizes location with up to four separate arrow sets, one for each enabled radar band, or for laser if fewer bands are active. The V1 Screen reproduces V1’s front-panel warnings including signal strength, Bogey Counter and Radar Locator plus frequency of the Priority Alert. Or you can choose the (Threat) Picture Screen or the Threat List, which shows a list of all signals within range, each with an accompanying arrow to show direction. The list order is arranged according to time tracked, newest signal at the top. A flashing arrow marks the Priority Alert and a yellow “Box” symbol indicates “in the Box.” 

BEYOND SITUATION AWARENESS 
Think of V1connection LE as the Master Controller for your V1 system. You can revise programming, adjust SAVVY settings, change muting, activate dark mode, save custom programming profiles for different trips, and more, all from your handheld. DEMO MODE IS AUTOMATIC. 
The audible warnings of your Valentine One can now be transmitted through your phone to your car's sound system, or to speakers in your helmet if you are a motorcyclist. Any other hook-up that allows you to hear your phone can also bring V1's warnings directly to your ear.

NEW PROGRAMMING OPTIONS 
Radar coverage can now be specially tailored to the unique radar bands used outside the U.S. Advanced users may want to modify the sweeps covering frequencies used here in the U.S. according to unique local conditions. The Profiles screen shows a menu of the variables you can modify. For example, you can select ""Background Notifications"" so that you can run other apps but receive instant notification from V1 whenever a new threat appears. 

THE APP IS FREE
Just download this free app. The Demo Mode plays automatically, giving you a look at all four warning screens playing through preloaded on-road scenarios. For further functions, you’ll need to purchase V1connection LE to communicate wirelessly with your Valentine One detector.",0

124,674234719,"Sentence Reading Magic 2 provides the missing link between reading words and reading books-reading sentences. 

This app works on developing reading skills using consonant blends and over 50 of the most common sight words. It has a special section to focus on learning 24 of the more difficult sight words to decode.

Sentence Reading Magic 2: 

*Helps children become excellent readers. 

*Familiarizes children with the 50 of the most essential sight words. 

*Takes children from reading words to reading sentences. 

*Prepares children to read decodable sentences and books. 

*Gives children crucial practice decoding, blending and comprehending complete sentences. 

*Offers children the opportunity to practice comprehension skills and increase fluency without becoming intimidated by a full page of print. 

*Provides children with the opportunity to become fluent readers. 

*Helps children to develop speed to read fluently. 

*Helps children to become confident readers. 


Most reading programs go from reading words to reading books. This can be too big of a jump for most emerging readers even if the books used are decodable text books. 

This app helps to bridge that gap giving emerging readers a gradual and fun step up from reading words. These short sentences are perfect to help children gain confidence in reading sentences. 

This app uses over 325 sentences divided into four categories and into 24 lessons. 

81  Two-word sentences
82  Three-word sentences
84  Four-word sentences
84  Five word and Six-word sentences

Sentence Reading Magic 2 has several sight word games for sight word practice. It also has several customizable settings for fonts, voices and reward sounds.                           


This app has two modes. The first mode is sentence building where children can move the words into their correct sentence position. The second mode is the reading mode where children can read the sentence and then check their work by touching the hidden picture. 

The picture is hidden to encourage word reading instead of ""picture reading."" Most young readers upon seeing the picture will guess its meaning and not even look at the words. The picture is hidden so that the child will read the words first and then only look at the picture to check their work. 

This app uses two and three word sentences, which are punctuated correctly and always begin with a capital letter. 

Prerequisite:  
Sentence Reading Magic 2 requires that a child is able to consistently and easily read short vowel word that contain consonant blends such as drum, fast, frog, grip and held. 

A child who is struggling to sound out most every word needs to develop stronger single word reading skills. If a child has to sound out each word and then, stop and think about each word, by the time he gets to the end of the sentence, he may have forgotten what the sentence was about. This is an indication that the child needs more practice blending, segmenting and building 3-letter short vowel words and then words with consonant blends. The apps that will help with consonant blend skills are 

ABC READING MAGIC 2 Consonant Blends
Learn to blend, segment and read words containing consonant blends.

ABC SPELLING MAGIC 2 Consonant Blends  
Learn to build and encode words containing consonant blends.

If the child is struggling with those apps, then they need to take a step down to gain practice and mastery with short vowel words.
The two apps that will help with this are: 

ABC READING MAGIC 1 Short Vowel Words 
Learn to blend, segment and read 3-letter words.

ABC SPELLING MAGIC 1 Short Vowel Words  
Learn to build and encode 3-letter words.",0

Just entering the Subject Matter (Rape, Murder, etc), or Case Title, or Case Number, or the Judges’ name, or even any natural key words, the search engines filters the search and narrows it down to the specifics set at the search criteria of the App. Thus, from one interface, the user can search through cases, statutes, gazettes, articles/journals, regulations and rules of courts.

To change the sounding pitch, simply drag the note up or down the staff. The pitch standard for A4  is adjustable and includes pitch standards for early music performance as well as a range around A440.

Orefeo's metronome gives the standard range of metronome marks plus an extended slow range down to 10 bpm. It includes a visual display, the ability to set the rate by tapping a choice of standard MM or arbitrary bpm  and a choice of emphasis.

Orfeo is localized for English and Japanese. Some iPhones seem to prefer Japanese over English when they are set for another language such as German or French.  If Orfeo starts in Japanese and you want English:

1) Set the phone's language to English.

2) When it is finished, set the language back to your desired language.

Commercial, Juridical & Economic terminology

■ Over 30000 entries including idiomatic terms
■ A wide range of essential terms frequently used by businessmen. Lawyers, students and translators
Latin & French expressions

Target users
This dictionary is meant to answer the needs of persons confronted with economic and juridical terminology in their everyday activity, 
students, translators, business people of all kinds (manufacturers, marketers, forwarders, insurance agents, 
Customs officers and others), workers in law-related disciplines, as well as the general Hebrew-speaking or Anglophone public.
The present dictionary does not substitute for an ordinary dictionary – 
but rather supplies such English and Hebrew words and phrases as do not generally appear in extant dictionaries. 
It therefore sets out to help people with a good basic knowledge of English.

Vocabulary
The dictionary aims at translating words and phrases in their juridical, economic etc. context, offering meanings, 
which may slightly or considerably differ from the usual, everyday ones. 
Therefore it will not include all the regular keywords, but focus on word and word-combinations specific of the spheres it comprehends. 
Neither will it contain all the meanings of a given keyword; solely the ones relevant to the domains considered.

206,1063780961,"Designed for clinicians, Synapse Connext Mobile by TeraMedica makes it easy to capture content such as images, video, audio and notes from your tablet or smartphone and store them directly in the patient record. Simply select the patient from your worklist, and capture as much content as desired. Images, Video and Sound files are stored at full resolution in the VNA, and a link is sent to the EHR associated with the specific patient encounter. This makes it easy to find and compare “like priors”.
If using an EHR mobile app such as Epic’s Haiku/Canto or Cerner’s PowerChart Touch, Connext Mobile can be launched directly from the app and will have the full patient and user context. Otherwise, the app shows a list of all patients scheduled for the day, saving the clinician from duplicate data entry. Patient meta-data and encounter information is stored securely with the images in the VNA and available throughout the organization. 
Connext Mobile supports an encounters-based workflow. This matches existing workflows in departments where content is routinely captured at the point of care, eliminating the need to place an order prior to taking a photo or recording audio or video. Additional metadata, customizable per department can be captured at the point of care. Suggested departments include:
* Dermatology
* Wound Care/Management
* Pediatrics
* Primary Care
* Infectious Diseases
* Burn Care
* Ophthalmology
* Otolaryngology
* Plastic Surgery
* Podiatry
* ER/Trauma
* Audiology

5 reasons to choose Keepery over other password managers:

- Keepery does not require a monthly fee/subscription to backup your data. Most password managers do.
- All the data is encrypted using AES-256 with a randomly generated master key. This is state of the art standard on password managers.
- Your data never leaves your device.* There is no server side and no third party to trust.
- Keepery is as simple as robust, just generate and save secure passwords, accounts info and notes, and store an encrypted backup of all your data wherever you want, with one single touch.
- Coming soon Keepery open source code available on GitHub.

* * Your data never leaves your device until you decide to make a backup. When you make a backup, a strongly encrypted file will be exported to the service of your choice (dropbox, drive, email, local storage…). As long as you keep your master key safe the encryption protecting your backup will ensure that your data remains private, even in the hands of a malicious attacker. A highly efficient brute force attack against your backup file will take millions of years (actually much more than the age of the universe) to break your privacy.",0

263,896008986,"NetMotion Mobility® is an intelligent VPN that provides performance optimization, WAN acceleration, adaptive policy controls, and operational intelligence data for all major desktop and mobile platforms giving you the most reliable connection of any mobile VPN.

Mobility 11.40 features:

 - Ground-breaking security to enforce device-wide VPN use on iOS devices
Enforce deployment-wide VPN usage on supervised iOS devices to prevent users from accidentally or willfully sending unsecured data.

 - NetMotion is the only VPN vendor that can enforce deployment-wide VPN use. If the VPN is not active, Mobility blocks all application traffic. This new capability is available to Apple iOS DEP-enrolled devices in supervised mode. When enabled, apps cannot access the network if the user knowingly or accidentally disables the VPN. Security-conscious administrators can reclaim control and enforce remote access security without configuring a per-app VPN for every app on the device.


 - Quality-of-experience and network priority for advanced carrier networks
On every client platform, Mobility supports 3GPP network standards for setting priority, providing transparent and consistent quality of service on advanced carrier networks. 

Advanced carrier networks including FirstNet, AT&T ADTM, and Verizon Business Services, use 3GPP standards for packet tagging to prioritize traffic on the network by user and data type so that important data receives priority routing. Most applications need to be re-written to use the standard, unless they’re being secured by Mobility 11.40.  

Mobility 11.40 is the only VPN that can set priority by policy so that applications don’t need to be rewritten or upgraded to support priority tagging standards. Mobility also fully supports priority tags set by the operating system and by newer, compatible applications. 


 - Built-in Skype optimizations improve performance and reliability
Ensure high-quality video over low-quality networks. Mobility 11.40 now automatically optimizes Skype for Business and other video conferencing solutions, maintaining clear audio and video even when networks have sub-optimal performance.

Microsoft recommends <1% packet loss and less than .05% out-of-order packets to ensure a quality experience with Skype. Even the best carrier networks can drop packets at a higher rate, and packet loss on public Wi-Fi hotspots regularly runs 25% or more. 

Mobility 11.40 automatically optimizes Skype for business over networks with variable performance, providing clear audio and video under worsening network quality. Watch our videos showing how our patented packet loss recovery technology maintains high quality audio and video streams, even with 25% packet loss or more. (https://youtu.be/xRRmLWrTiwk) 


 - Support for Mobile IQ® 2.0 data correlation and optimized publishing
Mobility v11.40 and Diagnostics 4.5 standardize the way in which device and user names are exported to Mobile IQ 2.0. This allows Mobile IQ to correlate the located performance and per-application network traffic data from Mobility and Diagnostics with the users and devices that generate them. 

Mobility 11.40 also adds a new data type for Mobile IQ 2.0 that logs application flow destinations periodically, optimizing published network flow data.


 - More flexible enforcement of FIPS 140-2 validated cryptography
Frequent operating system updates combined with evolving methods from NIST for classifying cryptographic libraries complicate the task of maintaining a list of ‘valid’ libraries for security auditors. Mobility 11.40 makes it easy to preserve those modifications when the server is upgraded by prompting admins to reconcile their modified list of libraries with the list that NetMotion ships with each release.

Points are scored by bidding for and winning tricks, which in this game are called books.


*No Trump Bids will double your points(win or lose the bid)

The Bidding

The turn to bid goes around the table only once starting with the player to the left of the dealer. Each bid consists of a number from 4 to 7, and a suffix ""uptown"", ""downtown"", or ""no trump"".

The number indicates the number of books above 6 that the bidder's team will contract to win - for example a bid of 5 is a promise to win at least 11 books (6 + 5). As there are 13 books in all, 7 is the highest possible bid.
Uptown (or ""high"") means you intend to name a trump suit, and that high cards will win.
Downtown (or ""low"") means that you intend to name a trump suit, and that low cards will win.
No Trump means that there will be no trump, and that if you win the bidding you will then determine whether high or low cards will have preference.",0

Other scrollable rulers allow you to scroll through the ruler but are useless for measuring anything longer than your device because the start of the ruler disappears off the screen as soon as you start to scroll meaning you have no point from which to start your measurement.

344,1016071224,"Congratulations on your pregnancy! With this app we would like to give you a helpful tool, which will make food safety and good nutrition as simple as possible for you for the next nine months. What types of fish contain the least amount of mercury? Which types of cheese should you first strike off of your shopping list? And attending your next business lunch; what can you eat without worrying whether you’ll get toxoplasmosis? This app features a traffic light food labelling system of almost 1000 foodstuffs – they are categorized according to the level of danger to the unborn baby. Due to the background information and advice, you will feel more secure in the complex evaluation of the safety of unknown foods.

How the app works:
At first there is a theoretic part, which informs you in a nutshell about the most common foodborne diseases (toxoplasmosis, listeriosis, and salmonella.)
The core of the app is the food search. Here you can initially choose between an alphabetic or a filtered search. At first glance you can see whether a foodstuff is classified as green, orange or red.
Green-labelled food means that pregnant women can generally consume it safely - even if it is not necessarily healthy. Of course calories and nutritional value are another matter. On the same note, the permitted foods are always allowed in moderation. This applies especially to spices, herbs, and nuts. If you have a varied and balanced diet, you don't have to worry anymore. Orange let's you know that the safe consumption of the foodstuff depends on several factors (time of pregnancy, personal situation, the art of preparation, quantity, ...) But do not worry at first about the quantity of the orange entries, but do note the advice. Just click on the corresponding food label. You should absolutely avoid all red-labelled foodstuffs. They affect the development of your baby and damage it in the long-term.

Using the filtered search, however, you can adapt the list of the various risks and food categories to your individual situation. You can easily browse all accessible foods. Or you can filter through food categories and find out which cheese from your favourite camemberts you can replace during the pregnancy.

By clicking the star you can finally add the desired food to your personal shopping list.
By the way, with the help of our hints and advice you will also get guidelines for specific food categories and several more ideas for everyday use. That way you can ensure even greater food safety without getting hysterical.

We wish you a relaxed pregnancy. All the best!

- Describe and share your personal bidding style, thereby allowing your partners to view and recall how you bid prior to a session.
- Receive and store the bidding style of other players, allowing you to know or review how they bid prior to playing.
- Score and share the results of completed four player Bridge games.
- Document and share notable hands.

You may detail one or more of your own personal bidding styles. This tells others how you will bid when you are the first bidder of the partnership and when responding to partner's opening bid. You can begin by listing the common bidding conventions that you use. You can then refine this by adding detailed bidding scenarios. A sample bidding style is included to help you document your own personal bidding style.

To test your familiarity with your bidding style and the bidding style of other players, Bridge Binder automatically generates a set of flash cards from detailed bidding scenarios.

Score games using Rubber, Chicago and Duplicate scoring systems. Although the standard compass directions are used, hands are entered based on the location of each player seated around the table relative to the person doing the scoring. The app automatically generates statistics of each player's contribution to scores. You can print or email the statistics of each game to yourself or to other players.

You can record interesting and notable hands along with a discussion of how to bid and play the hand. This can be used by Bridge instructors to prepare sample hands of unusual bidding situations for classes, or for publishing hands on a regular basis.

The list of 255 words was selected to cover words that a child encounters most often when learning to read (high frequency), including words that cannot be learned using pictures (sight words). Learning to spell these words adds to a strong foundation in reading and spelling for beginning readers. In this game, your child will help Cimo the penguin reach an iceberg to catch fish. Each correct letter chosen adds a block to his bridge. Finish the word and Cimo can cross, but watch out for wrong letters, or Cimo will take a dip! This is the fun game to improve your child's spelling abilities.

Also included is a progress report for parents. The report allows them to track their child’s performance in spelling the sight and high frequency words, and provides play history with game details (i.e, On this date, your child has played level 1 and level 2 and in each game, what item has been asked and what your child has answered). An additional setup option allows for a parent or teacher to customize the number of questions to match their child. **In this new version, we add the options for self-correction (i.e, kids could correct their answer in the second try) and clearing out all the reports. This game will help your child improve their reading skills in a fun and interactive environment.

Features
This app is divided into 6 total levels to help children practice sight words in grade appropriate levels (Kindergarten, 1st, 2nd, or 3rd grade), with one additional level for high freqency words. The final challenge level mixes all the words together and adds incorrect letter options to increase difficulty.

The app covers the Colorado Rocky Mountains from the foothills to the alpine zone and although we show you a few plants found exclusively in Colorado, the vast majority of the plants shown can also be found through the Rockies of Montana, Wyoming, and New Mexico. 

We have been careful to include the most abundant and visible plants and also those less common but found in unusual habitats, such as, wetlands, ponds, and rocky slopes. We have also chosen species from various altitudes, from 85 families and 200 genera, and from all geographic locations -- East Slope, West Slope, and the mountains between.

We hope this app increases your enthusiasm for the plants that give us all life and inspiration. Revel in the wildflowers and infect others with your love of the land.",0

Crazy Alarm Clock is to normal alarm clocks what Mount Everest is to a molehill. When you absolutely positively have to get out of bed at a certain time, you need the most annoying and abrasive sounds known to man (or woman).

You choose a loud, obnoxious noise, such as, Angry Cat or Chalkboard Fingernails, then set your day and time. Be sure to turn your device's sound to ON, and turn the volume all the way UP! The app even has a pop-up to remind you to do this. Then, simply put your iPhone, iPad, or iPod to sleep by pressing the button no the top.

It's that easy.

You can rest assured (literally) that you'll be on time for that final exam or business flight because Crazy Alarm Clock will send you 5 timed alerts, a minute apart. Just to warn you, there is no ""Snooze"" button! We can't guarantee that you'll get restful sleep, but you WILL get out of bed.

Even if you just need a simple daily signal or a safe, timed plan to keep dinner from getting charred, Crazy Alarm Clock is the key. Here's what you get:

- Simplicity – Listen to the loud sounds, choose one, and set the alarm.
- Easy Sorting – Select your favorite sounds or arrange alphabetically.
- Cool Design – Check out the screenshots below.
- Obnoxious Sounds – The air horn WILL wake you up!

548,1129842349,"IAM Medical Guidelines is designed to help Canadian medical professionals to become more familiar with a curated selection of the many Clinical Practice Guidelines they are increasingly expected to know about.

IAM is a single container for these Guidelines; we started with an accredited program in partnership with the Canadian Thoracic Society and their 2012 Guideline Update: Diagnosis and Management of Asthma in Preschoolers, Children and Adults. This has been followed with recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of Asthma in preschoolers (2015), and Severe Asthma Guidelines (2017).

The app also includes Breast Cancer Survivorship guidelines deriving from the work of Marian Luctkar-Flude RN PhD, Alice Aiken PhD, Mary Ann McColl PhD, Joan Tranmer RN PhD and Hugh Langley MD CCFP, published in Canadian Family Physician (Le Médecin de famille canadien) Vol 61: november 2015. These key guideline recommendations for post-treatment breast cancer care were synthesized from existing guidelines produced by credible cancer care and primary care organizations, and align with the most recent guidelines published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the American Cancer Society in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Vol 34(6): 2016. In addition to recommendations for surveillance, these guidelines provide direction to primary care providers on providing comprehensive survivorship care including prevention, screening and interventions for common long-term and late effects of breast cancer and its treatment.

The latest version adds Breast Cancer Recovery guidelines for Breast Cancer survivors; this is the same information as in Breast Cancer Survivorship, but presented for non-medical professionals.

We are also adding GEC-KO, a channel published by Genetics Education Canada whose mandate is to increase genetics literacy in health care professionals and thereby enhance quality of care in order to optimize the health and well-being of Canadians.

We simplify study by:
•	Featuring only guidelines published by recognized authorities
•	Selecting the recommendations most important to the intended audience of each guideline, using a Delphi process
•	Working with guideline authors to condense each recommendation for easy scanning on the “Topics” page
•	Using Push Notification to gently highlight a different recommendation each week
•	Presenting each recommendation at three levels; Topics (searchable list of condensed recommendations), Recommendation (the full monte) and Guideline (the recommendation shown in context in the full guideline)
•	Optimizing the guideline for easy reading on small devices, while maintaining access to the full original content

We encourage study by:
•	Promoting reflective learning, using ITPCRG’s research-proven Information Assessment Method (https://www.mcgill.ca/iam/home-page); for each recommendation, a short questionnaire encourages reflection on how the information could be valuable to the practitioner
•	Working with the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (Royal College) to provide Continuing Medical Education credits for each submitted IAM questionnaire (where applicable).
•	In the case of the Lung Guidelines, we provide a Forum where the Recommendations can be discussed.

All the app content is stored on our servers and downloaded to your device when you add a new channel, so you can study anywhere – the subway, in-flight, at the cottage…  As new guidelines are added, they will become available for download, and corrections and updates to existing guidelines will be incorporated seamlessly. The app keeps itself up-to-date.

Our goal is to become a one-stop shop for Medical Guidelines, so that you only need to invest your valuable time (and iPhone homepage real estate) in a single app, rather than downloading and learning about a separate app for each guideline.",0

Beginning Sounds is a comprehensive collection of sound spelling cards for students who are getting ready to read by helping them practice beginning sounds for each letter of the alphabet. 

When it comes to learning phonics, repetition is very important, especially for students that are already struggling.  These workbooks with over 200 beginning sound cards are designed to give you students extra practice in a fun, simple, easy and engaging way.

Please ask your students to say each page following the pattern below.

""A says 'a' as in alligator.

I use these beginning sound workbooks to reinforce new phonic sounds.  They are great for daily repetition and reading practice.  

The best way to first use this app is together with a student.  Whenever they see a page, ask them to read each page.  If they get stuck, they can tap on the word or phonics sound to get help.  Once a student has been introduced to the app, they can also continue using it independently to gain confidence in their reading, spelling, and phonics.

WHY TEACHERS AND PARENTS LOVE BEGINNING SOUNDS
- I can use it to introduce new beginning sounds
- I can use it as a guided reading practice
- I can use it in my reading word work centers
- I can use it for daily reading practice with my students
- It includes a lot of beginning sounds for each letter
- Fun graphics and huge variety keep kids engaged
- Professional sound recordings make the workbook fun and interactive and allow kids to learn phonics at their own pace 

What sounds are included?
- All beginning sounds from a to z with up to 10 examples per letter 
- There is one workbook for each letter

606,1100482356,"Ricardo Reading Mouse is sure to delight children, as they enjoy learning their ABC’s with him, in three, beautifully illustrated, educationally-based games. Great care has been taken to ensure each game, develops essential early literacy skills in a safe, supportive, encouraging and fun way. We have no in-app purchases or live streaming.

As children interact with Ricardo, they will meet the 26 letters of the English Alphabet.
They will learn to:
1. recognise letter shapes;
2. recall letter names and sounds and
3. identify and remember the initial letter-sound associations of the 21 consonants and the 5 short vowel sounds of the English Alphabet.

This app has been designed to target primarily the under 6’s and it is a beautiful addition to any classroom or home learning environment. It is also a perfect place to engage older children who are struggling and require extra time and support to practice learning their letter names and sounds.

THREE GAMES:
Hidden Letters – find the correct alphabet letters as they play hide and seek
Vowel Catch – help vowel characters catch matching kites
I Hear – help Ricardo jump across the river rocks by matching letters and sounds

Each game has three different levels, systematically introducing and teaching lowercase letters, uppercase letters and beginning sounds of words. Children can freely move between each game and level within a game, at their own pace by selecting a game on the main home screen and then by selecting a level on the first screen of each game.

Instruction boxes with text and audio automatically open up on each initial play of the game and upon repeated game plays. The instruction box can then be selected with an icon on screen. There are indicators on the screen in each game which show the child’s progress throughout the game and how many screens are remaining before a reward screen appears.

We recognise the importance of children needing a healthy balance of screen time and active play time. So attention has been given, to ensure we provide games and rewards that serve as a gentle reminder to children of how much fun it is to put their device down and engage in safely supervised active play like flying a kite, using a scooter or pogo stick, leaping and jumping, enjoying nature play or playing hide and seek. 

Such active play also assists in the development of visual motor skills which are vital when learning to read, write and spell. Disclaimer: Children’s activities are always at the discretion of their supervising carer.

Some levels within the games have interactive rewards. Ie. fast, normal and slow buttons where children can change the pace at which Ricardo is doing an activity.  For other rewards, children have the joy of seeing Ricardo appear doing a task to a pleasant, up-beat little instrumental or vocal.

As children are naturally inquisitive, there are also some surprise interactive touch points, in the games, that when pressed will delightfully reward children with a movement, a sound or both.  We trust you will enjoy exploring these with your child.

LOCKED PARENT SECTION FEATURES:
1. More information about the visual processing aspects of this app
2. In app settings, there are further details specifically for the Hidden Letters game:
  a. There is an additional setting which will make the game harder by reshuffling the hidden letters more frequently.
  b. There is a question mark icon on the screen, which when pressed, provides a few verbal clues for possible hiding spots.
  c. There is provision of an answer key revealing all 26 hiding spots.
3. Rate and Review section
4. Access to more learning resources via the links to our support website and Youtube channel

We are a new family-owned company launching into this space.  Your support is very much appreciated and we are very keen to hear your comments/feedback. Thank you!

609,1016072001,"Congratulations on your pregnancy! With this app we would like to give you a helpful tool, which will make food safety and good nutrition as simple as possible for you for the next nine months. What types of fish contain the least amount of mercury? Which types of cheese should you first strike off of your shopping list? And attending your next business lunch; what can you eat without worrying whether you’ll get toxoplasmosis? This app features a traffic light food labelling system of almost 1000 foodstuffs – they are categorized according to the level of danger to the unborn baby. Due to the background information and advice, you will feel more secure in the complex evaluation of the safety of unknown foods.

How the app works:
At first there is a theoretic part, which informs you in a nutshell about the most common foodborne diseases (toxoplasmosis, listeriosis, and salmonella.)
The core of the app is the food search. Here you can initially choose between an alphabetic or a filtered search. At first glance you can see whether a foodstuff is classified as green, orange or red.
Green-labelled food means that pregnant women can generally consume it safely - even if it is not necessarily healthy. Of course calories and nutritional value are another matter. On the same note, the permitted foods are always allowed in moderation. This applies especially to spices, herbs, and nuts. If you have a varied and balanced diet, you don't have to worry anymore. Orange let's you know that the safe consumption of the foodstuff depends on several factors (time of pregnancy, personal situation, the art of preparation, quantity, ...) But do not worry at first about the quantity of the orange entries, but do note the advice. Just click on the corresponding food label. You should absolutely avoid all red-labelled foodstuffs. They affect the development of your baby and damage it in the long-term.

Using the filtered search, however, you can adapt the list of the various risks and food categories to your individual situation. You can easily browse all accessible foods. Or you can filter through food categories and find out which cheese from your favorite camembert you can replace during the pregnancy.

By clicking the star you can finally add the desired food to your personal shopping list.
By the way, with the help of our hints and advice you will also get guidelines for specific food categories and several more ideas for everyday use. That way you can ensure even greater food safety without getting hysterical.

We wish you a relaxed pregnancy. All the best!

615,602933086,"Sleepy Time zZz is the only app that cares about your sleep. It makes sure you go to bed on time by letting you set bedtime reminders. It makes sure you wake up rested by using an advanced algorithm to detect when you're in light sleep so it could wake you up at the perfect time. It also motivates you to get out of bed by providing you with a motivational/inspirational quote after you stop your alarm. It also features a sleep cycle calculator which can help you find the best wake up times for a given bedtime or best bedtimes for a given wake-up time.

Let’s assume you’re going to bed right now. Wouldn’t you want to know what are the best times for you to wake up? Or let’s assume you’re a student studying for an exam late at night, all you know you have to be up at 7 in the morning, wouldn’t you want to know what are the best times for you to go to bed so you could cram as much as possible for the exam while still waking up refreshed? 

But it doesn’t stop here. You can set an alarm to wake you up at any time you desire. That alarm will wake you up within a wake-up window (or wake-up phase) you specify. For example, if you set an alarm at 8 with a wake-up phase of 30 minutes, you’ll wake up between 7:30 and 8. Sleep Time will use your device’s accelerometer to detect your movements in bed. Based on your movements, Sleep Time will know when you’re in a light sleep state, and then ring the alarm! The result is, a fresher, happier, and awesomer you! 
Sleep Time is very easy to use. All it takes of you to set an alarm at your desired wake-up time is: 3 taps. Do you want to know why? Well, it takes one tap for Sleep Time to calculate your best wake-up times, another tap to pick one of the suggested times (which is your desired wake-up time), and a final tap to set your alarm. Done! Goodnight! 

Features:
--------
•Sleep cycle calculator (calculates when to sleep or when to wake up) 
•Sleep latency (set how long it takes you to fall asleep) 
•Set an alarm with a wake up phase 
•Senses your movement in bed to wake you up when you’re in light sleep! 
•Shows you a motivational quote when the alarm goes off 
•A share button to share the motivational quote with the world! 
•Ten awesome sounds to wake up to! 
•Or, wake up to a song in your music library! 
•Uses proximity sensor to turn off display when alarm is set (iPhones only) 
•Set snooze time from 0 (off) to 30 minutes 
•Turn vibrate on or off (iPhones only) 
•Reminds you to go to bed at a time you set!
•Set your device’s sensitivity to your preference 
•Eight different color themes 
•Alarm volume adjusts automatically (from low to high) to wake you up smoothly! 
•Very elegant and clean interface! 
•Stop alarm by pulling (scrolling) down! 
•Snooze by pulling (scrolling) up! (When it’s snooze time) 
•And always, pull down to go back!

I personally was playing Tower Defense games all my childhood and played through almost all wc3 td maps. However, when I tried other tower defense games on the market I found that they were way too simple, or just plain boring. I made this game in hopes that it will give you the depth of old school games on modern devices.  Hope you like it. And if you don’t: leave me a comment so I can make it better =)

645,1166018485,"Please read the following desciption before buying this app! 

Tasks+Cal+Sync 4 is a niche app, suitable only when you need synchronizing contacts, tasks and calendar with a server or service which uses a standard called SyncML. The app does not support any other synchronisation technology!

So please buy this app only if you know for sure that SyncML-based synchronisation is really what you need! This may be the case when the IT people of your organisation say so, and maybe even explicitly recommend using Tasks+Cal+Sync to synchronize calendars, tasks and contacts. In any case, please realize that for using this app, you need to know the URL of your syncml server, the login user to use, and the so called server paths for contacts/tasks/calendar. Only the provider of the SyncML service knows these details and can support you in establishing sync with his SyncML server. We as makers of the SyncML client app cannot! 

By now, SyncML is a legacy standard. It was invented in 2000, and many of that time's feature phones did support it. Since then, it has been largely superseded by other technologies, most notably CalDAV and CardDAV, which iOS supports out of the box without any extra app. But SyncML still exists, and for some older calendaring systems, it may be the only way to synchronize. For those cases, Tasks+Cal+Sync 4 exists.

Tasks+Cal+Sync 4 is a rework of the former Tasks+Cal+Sync app, to allow using SyncML on iOS 10 and later (the original Tasks+Cal+Sync app only works up to iOS 9). But please note that Tasks+Cal+Sync 4 does not provide new features over the original Tasks+Cal+Sync - except for a contact list view with a way to easily assign contacts to groups. Otherwise Tasks+Cal+Sync 4 just carries the original Tasks+Cal+Sync functionality forward to make it usable with iOS10 and later.

So now that you are certain SyncML based synchronisation is what you need - here's the summary for Tasks+Cal+Sync 4:
• based on a mature and extensively interoperability tested SyncML engine, which powers many SyncML client and server products for different platforms (libsynthesis).
• synchronizes app-internal calendar (not the iOS calendar! If you want that, have a look at ""SyncML PRO 4""), app-internal tasks (not iOS reminders!) and iOS contacts to a SyncML compliant server or service in the internet or in the local network.
• can act as SyncML server in the local WiFi network (e.g. to keep really old mobiles in sync with an iOS device)
• has built-in tasks, month, day, week and list views for the iOS calendar (same as in original Tasks+Cal+Sync)
• has a contacts list for the iOS contacts, and allows quickly assigning/removing contact group membership (that's a new feature in Tasks+Cal+Sync 4)

647,1373636533,"Die NABU-App „Insektenwelt“ zeigt die bunte Vielfalt der sechsbeinigen Krabbler und bietet neben ausführlichen Artenportraits praktische Funktionen für alle Insekten-Fans und die, die es noch werden wollen. Detaillierte Informationen zu einzelnen Insekten sind in 122 Artenpotraits enthalten. Die Auswahl der Arten basiert auf den Daten von naturgucker.de. Es sind die am häufigsten in Deutschland gemeldeten Insekten der letzten Jahre. 

Die App bietet weit mehr als Basisinfos zu den bekanntesten Insekten:

Mit der automatischen Fotoerkennung wird das Bestimmen von Insektenarten kinderleicht. Ein Foto vom unbekannten Insekt kann direkt aus der App heraus neu aufgenommen werden oder aus der Bibliothek eingefügt werden. Die möglichen Ergebnisse der Bestimmung sind in einer Liste sortiert. Die Art, die dem fotografierten Tier am ähnlichsten ist, steht ganz oben. Aus der Liste heraus lassen sich die Artenportraits direkt aufrufen.

Einen weiteren Service bieten die Beobachtungslisten. Alle Beobachtungen können so einfach in der App gespeichert werden. Durch verschiedene Export-Möglichkeiten lassen sich die Daten versenden. Sie können sowohl auf den eigenen PC, als auch an naturgucker.de oder an den Naturschutzbund (NABU e.V.) übermittelt werden. 

Die Meldemöglichkeit zum NABU wurde für die Mitmachaktion „Insektensommer“ entwickelt. Die bundesweite Meldeaktion für Insekten richtet sich an alle Naturfreundinnen und Naturfreunde. An jeweils zehn Tagen im Juni und August können alle Insekten gemeldet werden, die innerhalb einer Stunde beobachtet werden. Gezählt wird von jeder Art die größte gleichzeitig anwesende Zahl von Tieren. So werden Doppelzählungen vermieden. Wer Lust und Zeit hat, kann an mehreren Orten beobachten und mehr als eine Liste absenden. In der App werden die verschiedenen Listen übersichtlich dargestellt. 
 
Diese App ist ein praktisches Hilfsmittel für alle Naturfreundinnen und Naturfreunde, die mit ihren Beobachtungsdaten einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Insektenforschung leisten möchten. Ziel ist es, einen Überblick über die Häufigkeit der Insektenarten in Deutschland darzustellen, Trends zu erkennen und zu helfen, nötige Schutzmaßnahmen mit auf den Weg zu bringen.

These monstrous parking machines are absolutely fascinating and a sight to behold. You will always notice that one passer-by who pauses for a moment to see this automated smart parking system in action. In this game, we have tried to simulate this system to give you a taste of the real thing.

Since we are going vertical, you need to be really accurate in parking on the given spot so that there are no balancing issues. You also need to fill the empty spots optimally to make sure the cars are un-parked in time.

""I like being able to study two ways: playing the matching game as well as drilling with the flashcards.""


Don't like our flash cards? Then make your own.

Simple Flash Card Maker lets you easily make your own flash cards. Either right there on your iOS device, or make them even more quickly on your computer (mac or pc) and import them using iTunes.

You can even download them ready made from the millions of sets available on quizlet.com. Or make your own flashcards on quizlet.com (using your mac or pc) and share them. (quizlet.com is a free website).

Or you download our ready made decks from within the app (for FREE). We currently have decks for Japanese, Chinese and the SAT.

Each card can have combinations of text, images, sound or video.

The text can be in any language that you can enter using your keyboard. 
Images and Video can come direct from your camera, from your albums or from your mac/pc.
Sound can be recorded live, from your music, or imported from your mac/pc using  iTunes.

Cards within your deck can be marked to be included (or not) when you are doing drills.
This lets you learn the cards 10 at a time. Easily add 10 more when you master those. And after you have learned those 10, easily drill yourself on the whole deck so far. 10 at a time is a great way to learn even a very large deck.

Easily drill just the last 10 cards at the tap of a button.

During a drill you can see either the front, the back or both. Or you can rotate to landscape and see ""Just the Card"", one side of the card filling the entire screen.

You can also do a multichoice drill and choose from one of four answers.

If you get a card right it is removed from that drill (not the deck). If you get it wrong it's shuffled back in and it will come back again later. Keep going until you get them all right.


You can also play a simple memory game (face up or face down) to test your knowledge of the cards by finding pairs of matching cards.

Simple Flash Card Maker is great for elementary maths and for learning to read.
It is indispensable for language study, and for learning vocabulary.
Use it to memorise your favorite Bible verses.
Or cram key facts for upcoming examinations.

Video takes it to a whole new level beyond old fashioned paper flash cards. 
Kids can learn from short videos instead of just static text or images.
They can record their own voices for names of animals.

Video is also great for learning things like sign language where complicated diagrams usually just make it harder to get started.

Regular practise and review is the only way to memorise anything using flash cards.
You always have your phone with you, so use those spare moments throughout the day to review your deck and you will be amazed at how quickly your knowledge grows.",0

697,1060636759,"Note: The Premium version includes all six emotions listed: Surprise, Fear, Anger, Disgust, Sadness, and Happiness. If you prefer to buy emotions separately, please see the in-app purchase version of the app.

Most of us begin the complex process of learning to recognize facial expressions in infancy. From the faces of parents, siblings, teachers, and others, we develop a considerable amount of expertise in this aspect of socialization at an early age.   Since this skill in recognizing emotions is so important in surviving, why not help your child develop it at an early age with this app? 

Faceland Emotion Schools show how to separate parts of a face - eyebrows, eyes, mouth - and tie each to different expressions. Videos first explain the meaning behind each feeling.  Why might someone be afraid or angry?   Then videos and photographs showing examples of different faces help describe what parts of the face change, and how, for each expression. Interactive games let your child practice on photos of real faces before moving on.   Practice with a mirror encourages children to copy each feeling as they learn.  Hundreds of real faces showing ideal expressions are randomly chosen to keep play challenging and fun.

If your child has behavior problems, it may be that he or she are not reading the social cues correctly, a problem in many disorders such as autism and attention deficits.  Reading skills development, which is equally complex, is systematically taught with letters, sounds, words, etc.  Why not use the same systematic teaching skills to help your child strengthen social skills with the Faceland schools?

Surprise, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Sadness, and Happiness were selected because they are the most basic of human emotions. Expression of these emotions appears in a variety of culture throughout the world. Paul Ekman began this research with a pre-doctoral fellowship from National Institutes of Health in 1955.  Faceland, designed by educators, clinicians, and game experts, utilizes research as a base to create structured facial clues to help children learn. Developed under an NIH grant, thousands of copies of Faceland have been used in schools around the world.  Controlled studies have shown it improves children’s understanding of emotions when used in either single play or school group settings.

●●● FEATURES ●●●

● 200+ challenging levels

● intuitive interface

● 4 types of special bubbles

● suitable for both kids and adults alike


●● TIPS ●●

● Form bigger groups of bubbles to make them pop. Drag a group of bubbles with the same color over another one to form an even bigger group and all the bubbles from that group will pop and you will score points.
● The bigger the group the more points you will score. The group must have at least 3 bubbles in order to pop.
● If a group is made of 3 bubbles, you will score 10 points for each bubble.
● If the group is made of 4 bubbles you would score 20 points for each bubble. For 5 bubbles you will get 30 points for each bubble and so on.
● You can make a joker-bubble by popping a group bigger or equal to 7 bubbles. A joker bubble can be a member of any nearby group and can be moved together with those groups.
● You can make a vertical or horizontal line buster bubble by popping a group bigger or equal to 12 bubbles. If you pop a line buster a whole line of bubbles will pop and you will receive 100 points extra for each bubble in that line.
● You can generate a super-joker bubble by popping a group bigger than 17 bubbles. The super-joker can be part of any nearby group and will pop all the bubbles on the map that have the same color as the group. For each bubble popped by the super-joker you will gain 200 extra points.
● You can optimize your strategy by popping two groups of bubbles with a third one by bridging the two.
● Including as many super-bubbles in one pop by a chain blast effect can greatly increase your points.
● If the group is dropped before gaining any new bubbles it will not pop. Thus you can strategically move groups around and bridge them to pop a bigger group afterwards.

A very easy to use counter for the famous Five-Minute Plank exercise. You know what is the next position and when to change it.

The Five-Minute Plank uses relative inactivity to challenge the abdominal muscles and strengthen them. In five minutes you get to exercise as many parts as possible of the muscle wall. The result: strong abs, a strong core, more power, better coordination... plus you get to look good on the beach.

What it works: Abs, chest, glutes, lower back & core

Tip: To gain the maximum out of your time in this exercise, tense your abdominal muscle group at each rep.

6 REASONS to start training:

1. Build yourself a smashing fit body - because there is no greater feeling than looking in the mirror and simply just love what you see.

2. Brag around about your toned muscles - low body fat level, noticeable muscle definition and shape, but not significant muscle size

3. Keep your heart strong and healthy - because your heart is a muscle also and it gets stronger and healthier if you live an active life. 

4. A clear and beautiful glowing skin - you don't have to worry anymore about celulite when you're half naked on the beach. No more dimply skin coming out of your swimsuit.

5. Reduce stress, anxiety and fight depression - regular training is the key for your head just as it is for your heart and will relax you, making you calmer, fighting depression and dissipate stress.

6. A happier soul and a bigger smile - you will feel that you are finally doing something for yourself.

768,785910082,"Developed by Dietitians, GO is the easiest meal and fitness tracker you’ll ever use. Simply pick your color, pick your size… and GO!  This finely crafted app offers one-touch meal entry that creates a visual food log more powerful, understandable and useful than typical calorie trackers.  

GO helps real people get real results:

""This app has been a tremendous aid in bringing accountability to my food intake and has helped me lose 50 lbs. since February. Keep up the awesome work!"" ~ Chris

GO plots each entry on an easy-to-read timeline in daily, weekly or monthly formats. This zoomed out view helps you see the big picture with a single glance. And when it comes down to it, your day-to-day habits are what really make a difference in your health.

GO can help you achieve your goals in the following ways:

1) The visual timeline is eye opening. You’ll instantly realize your personal strengths and weaknesses. Are you eating too much at night? Eating too many snacks? Skipping breakfast too often? Not getting enough workouts logged on a weekly basis? One look at a weekly or monthly timeline, and you’ll be empowered to make changes that pertain to YOU and the intricacies of your lifestyle.

2) You’ll find new motivation to stay on track. Why? Because you’ll naturally reflect on your choices. You’ll find yourself thinking: “I’ve eaten green healthy meals all day and I don’t want a huge red unhealthy meal on my timeline”  Or you may have a spiraling out of control “red” day – with lots of unhealthy meals, and you’ll find yourself wanting to add something “green” to make your timeline look better. Trust us, this really happens.  

3) You’ll be consistent. GO makes it easy to capture the most important details in seconds. It’s fast, it’s easy and it’s visual. That means you’ll use it consistently and make better choices more often – making you healthier with each positive choice.  

GO is built on the science of practical, everyday life. Typical calorie trackers are rarely accurate because we all tend to underestimate our food intake, overestimate our activity and we rarely, if ever, have the exact weight/size/brand/recipe to enter, making the whole process “just a guess” anyway. The point is, most of know when we make healthy or not-so-healthy choices… what we really need is the motivation to make better choices - and the visibility to see the impact of our choices over time.  

FEATURES:
• Enter meals and activities in seconds.
• Integrated camera lets you snap pictures of your meals for precise meal tracking.
• Interactive timeline shows daily, weekly and monthly views of your eating and exercise habits.
• “How to Succeed” coaching section offers practical guidance on what behaviors to look for on your timeline and how to make healthy adjustments.
• Syncs your results to the cloud.
• Automatically plots workouts you do with other lolo apps.",0

I am always looking for new and improved ways to get the personnel adequately trained and prepared for the oilfield and what you have is very good for entry level and junior personnel.

Or perhaps you're a student struggling to decipher the timeline and corresponding details of the many milestones that helped to shape America.  Either way the McGraw-Hill U.S. History Quiz app will prove to be an invaluable tool.  

Designed to assess a user's current knowledge of American history and based closely on the actual AP US History test given each year, this application consists of 80 multiple choice questions and provides detailed answers to each one.  The application measures your progress as you go along and allows you to save your work, returning later to finish the test at your convenience.  It also allows for repeated usage since, once completed, you can scramble the questions and take the test all over again.  To minimize frustration, the application also allows the user to skip a question, returning to it at a later time.

The content for this application was created by Stephen Armstrong, author of McGraw-Hill's 5 Steps to a 5: AP U.S. History.  Mr Armstrong is an AP History teacher, supervisor of social studies at Hall High School in West Hartford, and an adjunct professor of history at Central Connecticut State University.   

With each of 80 multiple choice questions providing 5 possible answers, the McGraw-Hill U.S. History Quiz application provides a thorough review of the major events and themes of this country's history.  From the settling of the Western Hemisphere and Colonial America in the 1400s to the current circumstances of Modern America, the user's historical knowledge will be challenged and broadened by this dynamic tool.  So whether your goal is to achieve your best score on the AP exam or simply to expand your personal knowledge of US History, this application will be an indispensable tool.

795,884476293,"Mele is an iPhone/iPad app that teaches words in classical Syriac (kthobonoyo), an Aramaic dialect. Mele means ""words"" in Syriac.

The Mele app is a game that is formed as a quiz. It is currently available in English, Swedish and German. Mele contains about 350 words in ca 20 different categories. Each word has a photo of it and a sound recording of how it is pronounced in Syriac. The Syriac words can be viewed in two scripts: Serto and Estrangelo. Mele has two playing modes: Play and Practice.

In the Play mode, the player gets to see a photo of an object and a translation of it in the chosen language. The player will guess the name of the word in Syriac by choosing one of three options. Each of these contains the Syriac translation of the word, a transcription of the word in latin letters and a sound recording of how it is pronounced in Syriac. The player gets to answer 10 questions (or less, if the category contains fewer questions) and has 15 seconds to answer each question. The player can collect up to 30 points per question, depending on how fast he answers it. Depending on how many correct answers the player gets, he will get 0-3 stars.

In the Practice mode, the player gets to see a picture of and hear a Syriac word. The player will guess what the word represents by pressing one of three options. Each of these contains a photo of the object. In the Practice mode, the player will not get points or stars, but will go through all of the words in the category. This mode is well suited for children.

Mele contains words in the following categories:

Animals
Buildings
Christianity
Classroom
Clothes
Colors
Days of the week
Family
Fruits
Furniture
Human body
Kitchen
Months
Nature

Previously the #1 App worldwide in all categories according to applyzer.com! Thank you for your support. We have more updates coming soon! Also, check out Bluetooth Photo Share Pro!

-------------------------

Transfer photos and/or contacts between two iPhones and/or iPod Touches over bluetooth. Requires iPhone 3G or later or 2nd generation iPod Touch or later (Bluetooth data transfer cannot be supported on the original iPhone or original iPod Touch due to hardware limitations). Does not require any 3G or WiFi connection.

This is the best bluetooth photo sharing app out there, and it's free!!

Here are some features that make this app stand out:

- Unlike some other photo sharing apps, Bluetooth Photo Share does not scale down or do any lossy compression of your photos before transferring. In other words, the receiver gets the exact image that was in the sender's photo library.
- Allows you to transfer contacts from your address book.
- The receiver transfer screen includes a thumbnail preview of the photo AS IT IS BEING TRANSFERRED and a cancel button so that you can cancel the transfer if you decide you do not want it.
- Shows a scrollable list of thumbnails and file sizes for all of the images that you've received.
- Allows you to view your photo albums that your photos were saved in.
- inApp Upgrade available Select Multiple Photos and remove Ads.

We are also working on some great new features that we hope you'll really like. We have a website(in English):http://iphonemart.net. Also check us out on twitter at http://www.twitter.com/iphonemart

-------------------------

Most of the time, the app works great. However, when people experience problems, 99% of the time it is related to connecting with bluetooth, which would be the same for any bluetooth App. If you have any trouble connecting, please check our support webpage for troubleshooting information.

Note that if you are trying to transfer photos from your old phone or to/from your computer, there is no way to do that on the iPhone with bluetooth.",0

Eine interaktive Fassung der STIKO-Empfehlungen und weitere hilfreiche Informationen rund ums Impfen sind nun in einer einzigen App zu finden.

o	Die aktuellen STIKO-Empfehlungen
o	Empfehlungen zu Impfungen bei bestimmten Risikogruppen (Indikationsimpfungen)
o	Empfehlungen zur postexpositionellen Prophylaxe
o	die Fachinformationen aller Impfstoffe, 
o	Antworten des RKI auf häufig gestellte Fragen (FAQs)

831,940050911,"Survive the zombie apocalypse with turn-based combat and permanent death! Manage survivors, go on dangerous scavenging runs, build alliances, craft equipment, make difficult story-influencing decisions, defend your camp against undead hordes and experience non-linear rogue-lite elements. An innovative Indie Survival-RPG!

HOW LONG WILL YOU SURVIVE?
Just after the zombie outbreak you were fortunate enough to join a group of survivors and hole up in their camp.
But that doesn't set you out of danger! Food supplies are running low, injured survivors must be tended to and materials need to be scavenged to keep the camp intact.
The zombie threat increases steadily and gangs of hostile survivors keep you on the defensive.

""FINAL FANTASY""-STYLE TURN-BASED COMBAT WITH PERMANENT DEATH
Every survivor should be protected because you'll need all hands on deck to defend against the dangers of the apocalypse.
Scavenge supplies in zombie-infested areas, craft survival gear and buy and sell equipment to keep yourself and your camp members alive long enough to learn the skills necessary for long-term survival.
The combat system has its roots in classic role-playing games. You can fight strategically, learn to utilize various weapon types and use a range of bombs or traps.

ROGUE-LITE ELEMENTS
Should you fail to survive the apocalypse, you can purchase upgrades with medals earned in previous playthroughs to give your new character an edge to start with.
Unlocked pre-apocalypse professions of your character allow you to specialize in various jobs.
Each new playthrough offers different random missions and survivors to meet.

NON-LINEAR STORY WITH 6 DIFFERENT ENDINGS
A praised feature of Dead Age is its non-linear story with real in-game consequences. Decisions you make in conflict situations affect the story's future.
You can choose to be a hero and save more survivors, or let them die to stock up on supplies. You can build romance relationships with other survivors or start rivalries that may have disastrous chain reactions. 
Daily events offer new dangers and situations in which you must make choices that affect the survival chances of your camp.
Live long enough, and you'll have a chance to unlock one of the game's six possible endings.

840,425200130,"Word Assist is a tool to help you find words to play in the game Words With Friends (WWF) or other word tile games. Word Assist was designed to help you improve your play, yet not do so much, that it takes away the excitement and challenge of the game. Word Assist frees you from the tedium of searching a long list of words, or guessing at random combinations of letters hoping for a valid word, and allows you to focus on the real strategy of the game.

On the Home screen of Word Assist, you can enter your letter tiles, then enter your search string, a maximum length for the word, and click a button to look for the search string at the start of the word, the end of the word, or anywhere in the middle of the word. Example, say your tiles are z,h,o,r,t,e,u and there is a word on your game board 'back'.  You could enter 'back' as the search term, with a max len of 15 and click In Middle, and you would get results such as 'backhoe' worth 19 points or 'outback' worth 18 points.  The results returned are all those words that can be made given the search term (tiles already on the board) and your own letter tiles.

Now, Word Assist does not take into account Double or Triple Word or Letter square values.  This is where the player must employ their own strategy, and is what keeps the game fun to play.  A result that may have a lower word score may be more valuable if a high value tile falls on a Triple Letter square, so, it is up to the player to choose the best word from the list of results.  Why play the game at all if your App plays the game for you?

Here are some other search terms that you could enter and what they mean:

Your Tiles: d,a,e,n,r,i,r

Search term 'elude' with a max length of 15, clicking In Middle returns 'deluder', 'deluded', 'eluded', 'eluder'

You can also use an underscore to be a placeholder for any one of your tiles:

Search term 'v_i' with a max length of 8, clicking In Middle returns 'vainer', 'vein' etc.

Word Assist also has a Lookup Screen (click the magnifying glass on the Home Screen navigation bar). The Lookup Screen searches the dictionary without any regard for the tiles that you have. So, it is a way for you to verify if a particular word you have in mind is in the dictionary or not. For example, if you were not sure if 'na' was a valid word, you could enter this in the search field on the Lookup Screen, click Search, and if the word is returned as a result, then it was found in the dictionary.  If no results were returned, it does not exist in the dictionary.

You may perform some advanced searches on the Lookup screen using 'wildcard' characters. So, similar to the way we used the underscore (_) character on the Home Screen to be a placeholder for any single character, you could enter 'f_z' in the Search field and click Search and the words 'fez' and 'fiz' will be returned. In effect, your wildcard search requested any three letter word starting with 'f' and ending with 'z'. 

You can also use the wildcard character '%' to represent 'any number of characters'. So, if you entered '%z' in the Search Field and clicked Search, then you would get results such as 'razzamatazz' (worth 50 points!). Your wildcard search requested words of any length ending with the letter 'z'. 

You may also combine wildcard characters. So, if you entered '__z%' in the Search field, and clicked Search, you would get 'razzamatazz' and 'zyzzyvas' since you requested words of any length, starting with any two letters followed by a 'z'. 

Word Assist eliminates the tedium of looking through long word lists for valid words, without taking away the fun and challenge of playing the game!",0

This is a great idea. I sure wish I had something like this when my boys were young. But I do have my grand babies now and it comes in very handy.


This app will stick to your hands whenever soothing a baby, putting the baby to sleep, playing with your baby and resting yourself and etc

- When the baby is crying
- When needs sleeping training during a few months after born
- When needs sound playing with the baby
- Many sound contents(White noise, Lullaby, Playing with baby) are included

~ White noise: All babies heard the mother's blood flow sound, hear beat sound, etc in mother's womb for about 3 months and they are accustomed to these sounds. 
After a baby is born, they feel safe when they hear white noise similar to these sounds.
This is already typical way to soothing babies nowadays.

~ Lullaby: These contained musics are helping babies to sleep.

~ Playing with my baby: These funny and exciting sounds make your baby feels fun and interesting. If you turn on one of drum beat sound and add another sounds, they can like those sounds.

~ Timer: Timer is operating with white noise and lullaby so that parents can set up the time to volume down smoothly and stop the sounds

875,520096352,"One of the best puzzle games is now finally available as an App, including 108 brand new challenges. Launch the lifeboats, patrol the water and rescue all the passengers who've gone overboard! Titanic by SmartGames is a fascinating sliding puzzle with simple rules but with challenges that are surprisingly hard to solve.

""Titanic easily makes it onto the list of Best Puzzle Apps of 2012."" - gottasolveit.blogspot.com

HOW TO PLAY
Move your lifeboats in such a way that all drowning passengers can climb in and be saved. When a sloop passes by someone in the water, the drowning man will of course save himself. It’s this aspect that makes the gameplay particularly interesting, because it requires strategic insight to see which passenger has to be picked up by which particular lifeboat AND in what order this should happen. This last part is crucial, as once the lifeboat is full it must remain anchored to the spot. So, from that moment on, the fully-boarded boat becomes an obstacle for other possible rescue work. This makes Titanic a constantly changing maze of people and boats.

ABOUT THE APP TITANIC (HD)
This App is based on the physical logic game ""Titanic"" from SmartGames and includes 108 new challenges and 4 levels of difficulty. There is also a lite version of this app with 21 free challenges. Rescuing passengers starts out ‘easy,’ but becomes the more and more difficult, until players reach the ‘extreme’ level.

ABOUT THE ORIGINAL TITANIC GAME
The original non-digital Titanic game was released in 2009 and comes with 6 lifeboats and 7 colored pawns for the passengers. The challenges are printed on challenge cards and remain visible through the “waves” of the 3D game board. All parts can be stored inside the game board. The original game has 48 challenges, all different from the challenges found in this App. Each challenge has only one possible end solution. If you like this App you will love the touch and feel of the original version too and vice versa.

ABOUT SMARTGAMES
SmartGames is a leader in single player multi-level logic games that are sold all over the world. Currently there are more than 30 different SmartGames, each with different play patterns. Popular SmartGames include puzzles like Anti-Virus, RoadBlock, Penguins on Ice, Camelot JR, Hide & Seek and many others. These one-player thinking games have already won over 70 awards worldwide.

884,923798127,"Ideal for bigger screened devices and use of a stylus for pin point accuracy drawing. Pencil Box is an easy to use drawing application that enables you to take advantage of a pencil, pen, highlighter, pair of compasses, ruler and protractor. It also offers you some preset backgrounds in the form of a pie chart, square paper, a grid axes, isometric paper, square dot paper and a blue tint background. If any of these don't take your fancy, you can import your own background from your camera roll or camera and edit the pictures like an overlay.

The app also benefits from 8 different screens that students can draw on and now share with teaching staff and vice versa. The exciting new sharing platform allows students to send their workspace to the teacher, who can then review, edit and then share back with every learner with the same class/group code.

How could you use Pencil Box?
Snap shot classic mistakes and ask students to highlight them, give all students an exam question, ask students to mark a snapshot of work, set homework tasks, or simply use the app to easily display what students have been doing. Any more ideas or examples of good practise, send them to mrwslab@gmail.com.

Other quick lesson ideas:
1) Take a picture of an exam question, provide the model answer, save it to your camera roll and upload it to your website for students to see. Alternatively if you are a student, answer the question and send it to the teacher.
2) Similar shapes - if a partner stands 10m away from the base of a building, take a picture, draw on the picture a right angled triangle formed by the base of the building, the tip and your partner. Use the ruler to measure the dimensions of your triangle and can you use similar triangles to calculate the height of the building?
3) Trigonometry lesson - using the protractor to measure real life angles and use appropriate measurements to calculate heights or lengths.
4) Take a picture of a students work and ask a partner to peer assess.
5) Take examples of students work using the 8 different screens and share the positive features.
6) Import an image to the stage. Using the tools available, sketch over the imported picture to trace it. Remove the imported picture from the stage and your sketch will remain.

Idea 4 and 5 require a projector connector or wireless connection to display on a whiteboard. Hopefully the lesson ideas would be applicable to any Maths, Science, Design and Technology or Arts lesson. I am a Maths teacher so this list isn't exhaustive. If you have any ideas about how you might use it in Maths or another subject, please email them to mrwslab@gmail.com and I will add them to the app description.

As a teacher I wanted to create a powerful resource for the classroom. The following tools are invaluable and a freely built into the app:

Tools:
1) Pen, pencil, highlighter and eraser
2) Protractor
3) Pair of compasses
4) Ruler
5) Preset paper - pie chart, square paper, grid axes, isometric, square dot, lined, blue background and lesson plan template
6) Insert text
7) Import from camera roll or take a picture
8) Save to camera roll

After your child looks over and experiences the animal flashcards, there is a fun game waiting for them, which tests how much they’ve understood. Regardless of the number of correct answers, the player earns stars and young talent is rewarded with thunderous applause and balloons!

In the free app, the animals are divided into three groups: “domestic animals and pets”, “forest animals”, and “animals of the world” (animals that live in Asia, Africa, the Arctic, and Antarctic). Additional animals, like “birds”, “insects”, and “world of water” (fish and water-thriving animals), are available in the full version of the application.

A significant feature of this app is that there are no unrealistic drawings. Instead, full-length beautiful pictures are used that resemble actual animals (as they look in real life), which helps the child easily remember their names and features.

Do you have older children in primary school? If so, this educational game will also come in handy for them because in addition to English, the app supports German, Spanish, French and some other foreign languages.

Playing these types of games with flashcards has been proven to aid students in quickly learning a foreign language. They can discover new words and are able to easily impress their teachers and classmates!

Your child doesn’t even need to know how to read with this app! Its simple interface and voice prompts allow even the youngest kid to play and learn the names of the animals by themselves! After playing the game, be sure to visit the zoo or pet store with your child – you’ll be happy and impressed as they present their newly acquired knowledge of all the animals they see!

Experience has shown that for most children, viewing and learning from bright and vivid images becomes a favorite pastime and having them play this game often reinforces their knowledge. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and founder of the “The Institutes for The Achievement of Human Potential”, training just 5 - 10 minutes a day stimulates the development of various parts of the brain. This allows for the development of a photographic memory, which means your could can develop faster than her or his peers, and become more open to the vast knowledge of the world.

Doman is undoubtedly right! The younger the child, the easier they absorb new information.

Animal Sounds is an educational games for kids which helps kids to entertain and help parents to teach kids about animals and birds.This animal sounds app includes more than 60 sounds of animals and birds.
With this animal sounds for kids app, toddlers can easy entertain them self with easy navigation.This animal sounds app offers HD animal pictures and by a simple touch on animal images it produces each animal sounds respectively.

I have found the paradox, that if you love until it hurts, there can be no more hurt, only more love.
If you judge people, you have no time to love them”
The whole of Mother Teresa’s life and labour bore witness to the joy of loving, the greatness and dignity of every human person, the value of little things done faithfully and with love, and the surpassing worth of friendship with God. But there was another heroic side of this great woman that was revealed only after her death. Hidden from all eyes, hidden even from those closest to her, was her interior life marked by an experience of a deep, painful and abiding feeling of being separated from God, even rejected by Him, along with an ever-increasing longing for His love.

916,1337461459,"Before starting this app, I expected there to be many HIGH QUALITY vocabulary apps there. While trying to give different recommendations to my niece of a vocabulary app, I realized there aren’t many HIGH QUALITY apps. Not an app that just has a list of words like a book. Not an app with too many ads. So I started a quest of creating an app that, at least to me, is HIGH QUALITY.

My SAT Vocab Manager has the following:

1. 5000 words carefully selected for SAT preparation.

2. Words are separated in a bundle of 10 so that you can memorize one bundle at a time.

3. You can add any or all of the words to My Words, which is like library so that you can have easy access to them.

4. BACKGROUND AUDIO. Our users love our Audio features.The app reads the word, definition, and example. Even in the BACKGROUND. You can turn the audio on in the background, and memorize new vocabulary while driving, exercising, cooking, etc.

5. DIFFERENT ACCENTS. Since there are many audio related features, and not everyone is located in US, this app makes sure to include other accents like British, Australian, Ireland, and South Africa.

6. MANY TESTS. It’s very important to test if you actually memorize the word or not. So there are multiple tests, spelling test, fill in the blank test and many more to test yourself. When you get a word wrong during these tests, the app will remember that particular word and it will show up on Test Results tab. This tab will keep track of all the words you had hard time remembering.

7. PUSH NOTIFICATION. Our team really doubled down on this feature. You can set push notification for all 5000 words, words just in your My Words, or all words in Test Results. Also, you can add push notification to take tests. Push notification is a very unique feature that no other people really focus on. 

8. NO LOGINS. There is no need for any account registration or required facebook logins. You can fully start using the app right after downloading it.



If you purchase our Premium Service, the bill will be charged to your iTunes account. It will be charged 24 hours before the end of on-going billing period. After making an automatic purchase, you can always decide to cancel the subscription on iTunes Settings page. The monthly subscription fee is $0.99. The price is based in U.S., so it could differ based on your location and could change without any prior notification.

Some days are considered to be very positive, beneficial, others can be difficult, problematic. There are also days regarding which different traditions contradict each other. 

This app invites you to form your own opinion about the Lunar Days and to compare what traditions are saying with what you actually experience in your life. It offers you to:

1. View the current, past or future lunar days for a specific location on the Earth.

2. View a summary of a specific lunar day's meanings offered by different traditions.

3. Write and save your own notes about the experiences that you had on that specific lunar day, and compare them with your previously saved notes.

Coverage FAQ:
Q: What's the difference between Coverage? and Coverage? Lite?
A: Coverage? Lite allows users to view maps from a single carrier (after a trial period with all carriers), and can be unlocked to include all of the features of Coverage?


Q: Why aren't the maps more detailed or released more often?
A: Our map updates require a lot of meticulous labor intensive processing. There's just no practical way to issue a new update everytime a new tower is turned on. We monitor new coverage and try to find balance between effort & staying current. 

Q: What makes 'Coverage?' unique?
A: There are great apps out there that collect user submitted signal reports - we recommend them and use them ourselves. However, those apps are only useful in markets with an active user base. We took a different approach with Coverage? - we needed a tool to at least give us an idea of where signal should be - urban, rural, and out in the boonies. Sure, carrier maps aren't a guarantee of where signal actually is, but it sure is helpful to know which direction to head when you need it!

Named 'Essential Tool' by Wired Magazine

""this app can be indispensable"" - Lifehacker.com

--------------------

The maps in 'Coverage?' are provided in partnership with Mosaik Solutions, and represent proprietary interpretations of the coverage reported by each carrier. You should not rely on the maps in Coverage to be perfectly precise or absolutely timely.

Ongoing map updates have been free - but to support the ongoing development costs, we now allow customers to subscribe to higher resolution maps that will be updated more frequently.

Coverage does not report or predict signal strength (there are great apps out there for that!). We can make no promises as to where you'll *actually* get signal

So… Got Coverage?

945,1144523564,"7 Minute Scientific Workout timer was sparked by the popular ""7 Min The Scientific 7-Minute Workout"" first published in the New York Times

In short, based on leading sport medicine practitioners, they created a 7 minute exercise that was highly effective AND could be done at home.

In 12 exercises deploying only body weight, a chair and a wall, it fulfills the latest mandates for high-intensity effort, which essentially combines a long run and a visit to the weight room into about seven minutes of steady discomfort — all of it based on science.

Benefits:
1) Burns the most fat in the least amount of time
2) Reduces the amount of time you workout to accommodate busy schedules
3) Uses bodyweight as resistance, meaning no equipment is required other than a chair

The routine involves the following twelve exercises performed for 30 seconds each with 10-second rest/transition periods before the next move:

Jumping jacks
Wall sit
Push-up
Abdominal crunch
Step-up onto chair
Squat
Triceps dip on chair
Plank
High knees/running in place
Lunge
Push-up and rotation
Side plank

When the workout is performed at a high enough intensity, the routine fulfills the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for vigorous physical activity, combining both metabolic and resistance training into one session. While the team that designed the workout admits there’s no “ideal” number of stations in a bodyweight interval circuit, the 12 they included in the sample template hit virtually every major muscle group. The 30-second intervals were included to allow for most people to perform 15 to 20 reps of each (with good form).


6 REASONS to start training:

1. Build yourself a smashing fit body - because there is no greater feeling than looking in the mirror and simply just love what you see.
2. Brag around about your toned muscles - low body fat level, noticeable muscle definition and shape, but not significant muscle size
3. Keep your heart strong and healthy - because your heart is a muscle also and it gets stronger and healthier if you live an active life. 
4. A clear and beautiful glowing skin - you don't have to worry anymore about cellulite when you're half naked on the beach. No more dimply skin coming out of your swimsuit.
5. Reduce stress, anxiety and fight depression - regular training is the key for your head just as it is for your heart and will relax you, making you calmer, fighting depression and dissipate stress.
6. A happier soul and a bigger smile - you will feel that you are finally doing something for yourself.

950,488639289,"In statistics, linear regression is a technique for estimating the relationship between an independent variable, X, and its scalar result, the dependent variable, Y, derived from a series of X-Y relationships.

The computational routine involves trying to fit a straight line between a scatter plot of X-Y coordinates such that the sum of the squared differences between each dependent outcome, Yi, and the line computed at each Xi is minimized. This is the so-called ""ordinary least squares (OLS)"" estimator.

R-squared, often called the ""coefficient of determination,"" expresses the ""goodness of fit"" of the line to the scatter plot. It ranges from 0, no fit whatever, to 1, which is a perfect relationship where all the points in the plot fit along the straight line.

The iPad version allows you to add, retrieve, reorder, or delete data sets. It also permits emailing, text messaging, and printing of a PDF report. Also, changing the form of the regression equation from Y = function(X) to X = function(Y) is allowed along with estimation of the dependent variable amount from a user-specified independent variable amount.",0

Glenn is one of the world's best-selling hypnotherapists with multi-million sales of his Apps, CDs, MP3s and 7 self-help books.

This powerful recording will take you on a special journey into the deepest levels of relaxation. The subtle background soundscapes supporting Glenn’s soothing voice will help you connect with a profound feeling of inner peace and calm. The focus is very much on empowering the listener and connecting them to their true spiritual nature. 

Like all of Glenn’s recordings it combines powerful hypnotherapy techniques with state of the art recording technology. The special background sound effects have been recorded in certain keys and frequencies to help enhance the meditation effect and guide you into a deep state of mental and physical relaxation. The main sound on the hypnotherapy track was recorded at 528khz, the solfeggio frequency, which is said to heal DNA, open your heart and induce feelings of peace.

At the deepest point in the meditation you are given a number of post-hypnotic and direct suggestions to help you connect with feelings of joy and happiness which will stay with you in your everyday life. There are also a number of background affirmations, which echo and pan from left to right across the stereo range, ideal when using headphones. This deeply relaxing and powerful method of delivering multiple suggestions simultaneously to the unconscious mind can facilitate positive changes very quickly. 

At the end of the recording you will be gently guided back to full waking consciousness with a combination of suggestion and music. There are also a number of positive subliminal suggestions, which are embedded in the fade out music adding to the overall effect. This amazing recording is a completely safe and very effective way of helping you to go into a deep state of relaxation and release anxiety and worry and feel very serene and joyful.

Gain proficiency in the use of the sounds of the letters.
Gain Proficiency with Auditory Discrimination.

This app has features and components necessary to give your child strong phonemic awareness. This app has features and components necessary to give your child strong letter awareness. This app will start your child off on the path to reading success.  This game is part of the ABC MAGIC PHONICS series. We recommend the other ABC MAGIC apps as a means to expand and reinforce your child’s phonemic awareness and letter awareness. 

This app has 3 levels of sequential learning for English learners to master. The sequence is designed to take the learner from the concrete to the abstract; from not knowing anything about letters to having good phonemic awareness. The app starts with using sounds and finishes with the letter symbols for both lowercase and uppercase letters. This has 3 lessons that each focus on a particular step of the Alphabetic Principle.

Lesson  1. Sounds to Images
Lesson  2. Sounds to Lowercase Letters 
Lesson  3. Lowercase Letters to Images

This app features 4 words pictures for each letter. Each word in each of the groupings uses only the most common sound for each letter. For instance, igloo and inchworm would be used for the letter i, but not ice nor ivy as those begin with long i (the second most used sound for the letter i). It is important to start by teaching just the most commonly used sound for each letter.

Sometimes unfamiliar words are used, in this app, to ensure that 4 words were used for each letter. Use this as a vocabulary building time. Even if the child does not know the word, the child can still listen for the beginning sound of that image. Another point is that this app is not a vocabulary quiz nor an object guessing game. Some pictures may seem indiscernible, but don’t worry, the objects, when touched, will ALWAYS say their name. The child NEVER has to know what the picture is ahead of time. Tapping on the image box will ALWAYS play the audio file that names the picture.

Please note, that in this app, only the SOUNDS of the letters are used and NEVER the names of the letters. A child can actually read without knowing the common names of the letters, but a child only knowing the names of the letters cannot phonetically read. The ubiquitousness of the ABC song both at home and at school will surely give children the ability to name the letters. Many children, however, are not given the much-needed explicit instruction of the SOUNDS that the letters make. This app, therefore, is dedicated to helping children learn the SOUNDS that the letters make.

These games are designed so that children can do them independently after being given the basic instructions of how to play the games. The app has built-in feedback mechanisms to help the child to work independently. These mechanisms allow the child to learn at their own pace and in their own way. The child does not need to be constantly supervised and told what the right answer is. This frees up the adult to be an observer of their child’s learning and to give assistance when invited.

Give your child the building blocks needed to learn to read. Combine fun, easy-to-follow activities with hands-on and audio features to jumpstart the learning process. Created by reading experts such as Dr. Fry, Kids Learn Sight Words uses developmentally appropriate approaches to let the child

● hear the words
● practice writing the words 
● recognize letters
● record the words with playback 
● use the words in activities

It combines fluency, vocabulary, spelling, and comprehension practice with entertaining, engaging graphics in a disguised-learning format. Children will want to play again and again and by doing so, will be learning up to 300 all-important sight words. Great for young learners and older children struggling with reading.

This app contains words 1–25 for free with an option to purchase additional word packs (26–100, 101–200, 201–300).  Each set of words comes with planned related activities. Activities change and progress as the child moves along:  

• Word Jigsaw Puzzle
Touch a puzzle piece to hear a word. Look for the word on the puzzle outline. Then move the puzzle piece onto the correct place on the puzzle outline. Repeat this process until the entire puzzle is put together. Word Jigsaw Puzzles are random and different each time; play as much as you like.

• Word Tic Tac Toe
Tap on the picture of the ear to hear a word. Click on that word in the Tic Tac Toe grid. Next, the computer takes a turn. Keep playing the computer until one of you has three in a row. The computer will also automatically say the next word to you. Tic Tac Toe games are random and different each time; play as much as you like.

• Word Matching Game
Touch one card to turn it over. Touch another card to find one that matches the first card. Keep turning over cards until you have matched all the pairs. Matching games are random and different each time; play as much as you like.

• Hangman 
Look at the blank lines at the bottom of the screen. Tap a letter in the alphabet. If you have correctly guessed a letter in the word, the letter will appear in the blank. If not, a body part will be added to the person. You have ten tries to correctly spell the word. Hang man uses the words you just learned, as you learn five words at a time.  

• Word Chain
Use the word tiles to make your own sentences. Be sure to use at least one of the words at the top of the screen in each sentence you make. Then touch the star to have your sentence read to you.  Shake to erase and reset the words.

• Star Speller 
Touch a star to hear a word. Touch a letter in the word that you heard, and drag the letter into one of the blank boxes. Keep dragging letters into the blank boxes until you have spelled the word. Touch the checkmark to hear the correct spelling of the word.

• Word Search
Touch each word on the left side of the screen to hear it read. Look for each word in the word search. When you find a word, drag your finger from the beginning to the end of the word to highlight it. Word searches are random and different every time; play as much as you like.

Settings: To set specific settings for this app, go to the Apps section at the bottom of the iPad’s settings menu.  Touch the Sight Words app’s icon to open its settings.  This will allow you to either automatically clear all content when the app is closed or save writings and recordings.

Superpedestrian is focused on urban mobility. Our mission is to help people move through cities more seamlessly. 

The Copenhagen Wheel contains a motor, batteries, multiple sensors, wireless connectivity, and an embedded control system. The Wheel learns how you pedal and integrates seamlessly with your motion, multiplying your pedal power 3x—10x. It makes hills feel flat and distances shrink, so you can cycle just about anywhere.

The Wheel app works with the Copenhagen Wheel to give you:

SMART CONTROL
All actuation of the Wheel happens automatically via the pedals through sensing and control algorithms. When you pedal harder, like when you're going uphill, the Wheel provides more assistance. Using the Wheel app, you can vary the level of powered assist.

TRENDS AND INSIGHTS
Get more from your Wheel through the Wheel app by tracking personal usage statistics including time, distance, calories burned, power, elevation climbed and more, all of which can be compared and shared with friends.*

YOUR KEY TO THE WHEEL
When you own a Wheel, the Wheel app gives you control of your Wheel, and allows you to give your friends and family access to your Wheel so they can share in the fun too.

1100,1153961240,"The Anza-Borrego Desert is part of the Colorado Desert that is a subdivision of the larger Sonoran Desert.

This is a free guide to the basics of identifying over 100 (this is the lite version, a full version is available as well) of the most common wildflowers in the Anza-Borrego Desert and how to tell look-alikes apart. Pictures show the characteristics you need including colors, flowers, leaves, stems, branches, and more.

Like to know more:

This is a free advanced guide with descriptions, keys, scientific names and families for over 740 wildflowers. Sort by common or scientific name. Select an individual family. Search options include partial name, scientific name, or family.
To add the full guide: No action is required in the iOS version, just press the black Full guide button in the app.

Is the guide complete?

The guide is as complete as we can make it right now. We add new flowers constantly after our desert hikes which are almost daily. 
But we are probably missing hundreds of less common plants and flowers, but one day we will find them.

When is the flower season?

The season for wildflower annuals reaches its peak from early February to late April. It is followed by a parade of perennials over the summer and fall and into the following year.
Rainfall can be very localized, it needs to fall at just the right time, in the right amount.

Is every wildflower season the same? No. Rainfall and temperatures vary from year to year and from place to place within the desert. Altitude is an important factor, too. Remember that the Anza-Borrego Desert region ranges from well below 1,000 feet to over 5,000 feet. The first flowers appear in the lower elevations and move higher through the spring.
Anza-Borrego is part of the Colorado Desert, that is a part of the larger Sonoran Desert.

Where can I find more information?
Our Facebook page and website are a good start, if you have any questions let us know.

Found something rare or interesting?
We are always interested, let us know A.S.A.P., on our Facebook page, or drop us an email.

Warning:

What will this guide do for you? Our hope is that our guide will help you identify the wildflowers you see, by genera if not by species. It will not make you an expert overnight. Some species, and varieties and subspecies, are difficult to identify, even for an expert. 

Never assume you have the right flower, always check if everything adds up, the most common mistake is to ID a flower, just by appearances and ending up with a wrong conclusion.

If in doubt, just post a request on our Facebook page and we or someone else will be glad to help you out.",0

Topics include:

● Kidney Stones
● Kidney Cancer
● Kidney Failure
● Bladder Cancer
● Diabetes Insipidus
● Dialysis
● Interstitial Cystitis
● Urinary Incontinence
● Urinary Tract Infections
● And many more topics...

Your kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs, each about the size of your fists.  They are located near the middle of your back, just below the rib cage.  Inside each kidney about a million tiny structures called nephrons filter blood.  They remove waste products and extra water, which become urine.  The urine flows through tubes called ureters to your bladder, which stores the urine until you go to the bathroom.

Damage to the nephrons results in kidney disease.  This damage may leave kidneys unable to remove wastes.  Usually the damage occurs slowly over years.  There are no obvious symptoms, so you don't know it is happening.  

This cool app discusses the most important topics in kidney diseases and is ideal for all medical professionals, medical residents and interns, nurses, medical students,  and of course curious lay people who just want to learn more about kidney diseases.

General Rules:
1:  After drawing tiles, each player places their bid.  The highest bidder sets which tiles act as trumps...a special kind of suit that beats any other kind of tile.

2.  The leading player may set down any tile he/she wishes.   If a non-trump is played, the  leading tile is highest number on the tile.   Doubles are considered the highest tile of any suit.   The rest of the players MUST follow suit if they can.  If they do not possess any matching tiles, then they can play a trump.  Otherwise, they will automatically lose the trick.  

3.  A player may wish to “Shoot the Moon” with a bid of 21.  They must win all the tricks in order to make this bid.  Depending on the House Rules, a bid of 21 will end all bidding.

4.  If the winning bidder fails to make their bid, their bid will be subtracted from their overall score.",0

The aim of this application is to improve the impairment of cognitive impairments in children with ADHD, such as attention, perceptual reasoning, inhibition, calculation, and verbal fluency. According to research conducted in ADHD, regular cognitive training can improve core symptoms of ADHD.

The Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Trainer is a cognitive training application designed for children with ADHD. The ADHD Trainer is adapted from another cognitive training technique; The TCT Method (Tajima Cognitive Training), which was developed by Dr. Kazuhiro Tajima-Pozo, an expert psychiatrist in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD.   

The TCT Method is a daily cognitive training therapy that entails multiple cognitive tasks. The TCT Method trains cognitive areas such as attention, memory, calculation, reasoning, and visuomotor coordination. 

The poor completion rate of cognitive training therapies presents a major hurdle to treat cognitive deficits in children with ADHD. Children with ADHD often evidence a lack of motivation, as exhibited through avoidance of tasks requiring mental effort.

Unlike many other cognitive training therapies, The TCT Method attempts to ""entertain,"" while challenging cognitive training is performed, creating an optimal level of motivation for children with ADHD.

The TCT Method of cognitive training entails children to play “games” for 70 minutes per week or 280 minutes per month. 

Dr. Kazuhiro Tajima-Pozo is a childhood and adolescent psychiatrist, and expert in ADHD disorders. He completed his academic training at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, New York. Dr. Tajima-Pozo has received several awards for his research in ADHD.",0

1236,699403933,"How hard can you kick a soccer ball? The world record exceeds 124 MPH (200 km/h). Do you think you can compete with professional players? KickPower will help you to improve your shooting technique by detecting the speed of a ball like a radar speed gun. Challenge your friends. It’s really fun. 

How it works 

KickPower analyzes a video stream trying to find a flying ball. After it is detected, the distance to the ball is calculated by estimating its size on the screen. Then the app compares consecutive frames and gets how far did the ball overcome between them. That’s it. 

You will need a soccer ball of a standard size and a friend who will fix your kick using iPhone. 

How to use KickPower for the best results: 

1. Choose a playground with enough light. 

2. Keep the distance of 20 – 40 ft (6 – 12 m) from the ball. 

3. Try to keep the screen parallel to the ball trajectory. 

4. Aim the camera so that the ball enters the gray area on the screen borders. 

5. Hold your iPhone steady. 

6. After the shot is done the ball speed is displayed. 

Note. Any shot taken in other conditions can result in a failed trial or lead to an inaccurate measurement.",0

That’s where the Powerball Advantage app comes in. 

It’s a Unique Number Generator that will help increase your odds of winning the full Powerball jackpot – or even just the $1 million jackpot for choosing the five white main numbers. You see, these five numbers have only repeated two times since 1992; that’s a whopping 2,678 drawings so far!

The odds heavily favor new number combinations, so don’t waste time picking a series of numbers that have been previously drawn. Instead, increase your chances with this simple tool that automatically generates random batches of the five main numbers and cross references each sequence against all past drawings. 

It’s so fast and easy to put yourself ahead of the game: first consult the Advantage app when you go to purchase your Powerball play slips at your favorite retail location. Then, instead of wasting time agonizing over what numbers to choose, let the Advantage app provide you with already-crosschecked numbers that will increase your odds of winning.

Often a list of the hidden words is provided, but more challenging puzzles may let the player figure them out. Many word search puzzles have a theme to which all the hidden words are related.

Word searches are commonly found in daily newspapers and puzzle books. Some teachers use them as educational tools for children, the benefit being that young minds can learn new words and their spellings by intensively searching for them, letter by letter, in the puzzle.",0

During the development phase, the Scrub Wars franchise was very popular at the 2014 and 2015 AMSA Annual meetings, the 2014 UC Davis Pre-Health Expo, and the 2013 DevLearn/Adobe Learning Summit (among students, professors, physicians, teaching administrators, parents, & gaming experts).

Spaced learning- High-yield board facts are reinforced by your Teaching Attending after completing each level (need 70% correct to pass a level). 

Content created by trusted sources- Questions written/edited/tested by physicians, professors, and medical students

1336,980946866,"Arevim is the only platform which enables Jews to easily offer help, and more importantly to seek immediate help from fellow Jews using their smartphones.

The concept behind the Arevim app is the ancient Hebrew maxim, “Kol Israel Arevim Ze La-Ze” – all Jews are responsible for helping each other.  

The app’s goal is to bring this concept into modern, everyday life, making this type of help possible anytime, anywhere.

With Arevim, Jews who need help are able to post their request using the app, and immediately reach all members of the Arevim network who are located within a specified geographical area. The app then enables direct chat between the requesting party and the responder, allowing the two parties to communicate and coordinate.
Registration for Arevim is quick and simple, using an email address or a Facebook account.

You can send requests for help as well as offer help to other members of the Arevim Jewish network, and find solutions to your daily challenges– such as:
 
-  Find a Minyan
-  Seek help for an elderly person (i.e. run errands, provide company, etc.)
-  Find a place to stay on Shabbat wherever you are
-  Get Kosher foods or ingredients
-  Locate professionals who are members of the community
-  Seek immediate help should you find yourself in distress
 
The Arevim app is simple to use – simply open the app, choose the type of help you need from a pre-defined list of requests or spell our exactly what you need. Select the geographical range for sending your request. Then press “Send.” The app lets you know how many Arevim will receive your message, so you immediately know how many members of the network are within reach.

Arevim respects your privacy, doesn’t follow your conversations, and also respects the need to post anonymous messages.
